<p class="cap">“Well, son, I guess I’d better be getting
along,” said Mr. Bingham. He glanced
frowningly at his watch and then across the
driveway at the dusty car awaiting him. He carefully
avoided looking at the boy beside him, and for
that the boy was very grateful. Now that the moment
for saying good-by had come Clif’s spirits, which had
been getting lower and lower during the past hour, had
reached bottom, and he knew that his face revealed the
fact. He was glad when his father went on, speaking
with exaggerated cheerfulness which fooled neither of
them, for there was a lump in Clif’s throat and he was
horribly afraid that it would make his voice sound
queer. Being only sixteen years of age, he was far
more fearful of displaying emotion than he would have
been of facing a firing squad, and not for anything in
the world would he have had his father suspect the
presence of that lump!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>“It’s seventeen after two,” Mr. Bingham was continuing,
“and I won’t be able to make as good time as
we did coming up, I guess. Won’t make Providence
much before six, probably. Got to get gas somewhere,
too. Well, I’d say you were pretty nicely fixed here,
son: nice room, fine buildings, lots of—of grounds, eh?
And the Doctor struck me as a particularly fine sort.
Not at all the type of man you—er—picture as a school
principal. Got a good business head, I’d say.
Well—”</p>

<p>Mr. Bingham looked approvingly over the scene,
nodded commendingly and drew on his left-hand glove.
Clif, realizing that speech was at last imperative, swallowed
hard. “Don’t forget to have some air put in
that left rear tire, dad,” he managed. “I think there’s
a valve leak. It was all right when we left home.”</p>

<p>His voice sounded sort of squeaky at first, he
thought, but he had it under excellent control toward
the last. He hoped his father hadn’t noticed anything
wrong with it.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Mr. Bingham heartily.
“Mustn’t forget that. Don’t want to have to make a
change on the road.” He turned down his glove at the
wrist—he always wore just one when he drove the
car, and never buttoned it—gave a final tug to his
tweed cap and began the descent of the six stone steps.
Clif followed, his brown hands thrust deep into the
pockets of his knickers, his well-set shoulders swinging
carelessly. Few fellows had arrived yet, but the
car stood in plain view of many windows and it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
up to him to affect a nonchalance he was far from feeling.
Mr. Bingham climbed into the seat, glanced again
at his watch and turned the switch. Clif slammed the
door shut with a bang. Mr. Bingham pressed down
on the starter and a low, steady hum came from under
the long blue hood. “Well,” he said, “let’s hear from
you often, Clifton.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Clif’s cheerful grin tightened up
harder than ever. He wondered if he would ever be
able to get the idiotic expression off his face! His
father’s use of his full name had almost done for him.
Years ago, when he was just a little kid, his father
used to kiss him when they parted; even after his
mother’s death, when there seemed no excuse at all
for it; but nowadays Mr. Bingham said “Clifton” instead,
and they both understood. And now he had
gone and done it again, and Clif’s throat felt worse than
ever and his eyes felt smarty and—gosh, he wished
dad would hurry up and go!</p>

<p>Perhaps dad suspected further delay might prove
dangerous, for he suddenly reached his ungloved hand
over the top of the door and said very gruffly, “So
long, son! Be a good chap!” And Clif returned the
tight grasp and nodded silently, and the big touring car
purred more loudly for an instant and swept off down
the blue gravel driveway and in a twinkling became just
a moving shadow between the trunks of the trees where
the drive curved to the gate. Clifton Cobb Bingham
watched it disappear, waved a gayly negligent hand—although
the lone occupant of the car never once looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
around—and then, that frozen grin still on his face,
lounged back across the gravel to the entrance of
West Hall. Probably, he was reflecting, not a soul
had watched that parting, but it wouldn’t do to take
chances, and so he played the rôle of stoic to the end,
or, rather, as far as the second step.</p>

<p>He was there when an object disconcertingly
obtruded itself on his vision. It was a brown, rubber-soled
shoe dangling from the end of an amazingly
colorful golf hose. Clif’s gaze darted higher and his
own fixed grin was instantly reflected. Only, whereas
Clif’s facial contortion was designed to express ease
and gayety, the countenance of the boy seated on the
top step unquestionably indicated derision. The fellow
hadn’t been there when Clif had followed his
father to the car, but he must have appeared soon after,
for his countenance said as plainly as words could have
said it: “You didn’t fool me! Almost cried, didn’t
you? Couldn’t even say good-by to him! Gee, what
a baby! Huh!”</p>

<p>Clif’s grin vanished. With one foot on the next
step above, he stood stock still and glared back at the
boy. He felt outraged, degraded and very, very angry.
The other stared steadily, maliciously back at him.
Clif’s hands closed and tightened. Then:</p>

<p>“Go on,” he demanded, his voice low and tight. “Go
on and say it!”</p>

<p>The other only chuckled mirthlessly, still staring.</p>

<p>“You—you confounded spy!” said Clif. “You
might find something better to do than sneak around,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
sticking your nose into other folks’ business, I should
think!”</p>

<p>The other boy’s grin faded perceptibly, but his look,
if it held less of amusement, was still dark with malice.
“Oh, shut up!” he answered listlessly. “Go on in and
have a good cry. You’ll feel better.”</p>

<p>“You get up from there and I’ll teach you a lesson
in manners,” cried Clif. He plunged up the intervening
steps and stood threateningly above his enemy. The
latter looked up almost eagerly.</p>

<p>“Mean it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Get up!” thundered Clif.</p>

<p>But the momentary gleam of animation faded in
the face below and the boy shook his head. “Can’t be
done,” he said regretfully. “I’ve got a date with one
of the instructors at two-thirty, and it’s twenty-eight
after. How about to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” jeered Clif. “You’re scared!”</p>

<p>“You bet I am, but not of you,” answered the other
dispiritedly. “I’m scared of Mr. Wyatt. Met him
yet?”</p>

<p>Clif shook his head, suspiciously. “No, but what’s
he got to do with—with you getting your nose
punched?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” was the gloomy reply. “He’s the English
shark here, and he’s going to give me the third
degree and tell me whether I stick around or beat it
home again. I’m a total loss at English. This Wyatt
guy’s the old man’s nephew or something and he’s a
tartar, they say. Well, figure it out for yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
I’m going to be up against it, anyway, but if I bust
in on him all smeared up with your gore it’s going to
make it a heap worse, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Clif scowled in puzzlement. His wrath was melting
fast, and the fact made him feel rather ridiculous. He
unclenched his hands, thrust them into his pockets and
summoned a note of contempt. “I hope he kicks you
out,” he declared. But the words lacked conviction.
The fact was that the strange chap, in spite of his behavior
and in spite of the detestation in which Clif
held him, sort of worked on your sympathies! Now
he nodded agreement.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess maybe that would be best,” he said.
He arose slowly, with a deep sigh, and stared morosely
over the wide stretch of lawn that, beyond a single
formal bed of scarlet geraniums and coleuses, led from
the school building to the village road. Clif watched
him frowningly. A straight bodied, finely built chap,
and, to an unprejudiced observer, extremely good-looking,
with hair that held a glint of bronze where the
sun reached it, deeply tanned skin, dark gray eyes, a
short nose and a rather assertive chin. If, thought
Clif, the fellow wasn’t such a rotter—</p>

<p>Then the rotter turned and looked moodily at him.
“You might wish me luck, you know.”</p>

<p>Clif laughed ironically.</p>

<p>“Because,” the other went on as he moved toward
the wide doorway, “if he turns me down I’ll be out
of this dump in an hour. If he doesn’t I’ll see you
in the morning. By the way, where do I find you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>“I’m in 17 West Hall, and my name’s Bingham.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Kemble. Glad to know you. Well, see
you again.”</p>

<p>He straightened his shoulders in the manner of a
condemned man starting for the gallows and disappeared
indoors. Clif looked after him, frowning in
puzzlement for an instant, and then followed. Beyond
the reception room a wide flight of slate stairs curved
to the second floor, and up it Clif made his way, his
footsteps arousing tiny echoes in the silent building. In
the second floor corridor one or two doors stood open,
but so far he had the Hall almost to himself. His door
was the fourth on the right. On the oaken panel was
an oval disk of white enamel bearing the number 17.
Beneath it were two small brass slots, in one of which
a somewhat yellowed visiting card indicated that Mr.
Walter Harrison Treat dwelt within. Mr. Treat was
not within at present, however, for when Clif swung
the door shut behind him he was the sole occupant of
the room.</p>

<p>His father had thought well of the apartment, but
Clif was not so pleased with it. It was large enough
and nicely furnished, but, although it contained two
windows, it was on the inner side of the building, close
to the angle formed by the junction of West and Middle
Halls, and the view was confined to the courtyard. At
Wyndham everything save the gymnasium was under
one roof, an advantage emphasized by the school advertisements.
The original structure, now known as
Middle Hall, formed the nucleus of the present plant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Within a year or two of each other, East Hall and
West Hall had been erected to connect with either end
of the old building. The three halls formed as many
sides of a quadrangle, with the opening toward the
front and the space between affording a seldom used
approach to Middle Hall flanked by turf and shrubbery.
This space was Clif’s outlook from Number 17. The
grass was smooth and well kept, the shrubs neatly
trimmed, the blue gravel newly raked, but Clif wondered
if one wouldn’t get a bit tired of that restricted
view after a while. Of course, it was possible to look
up and see blue sky above the slate roof of the opposite
Hall; and three pigeons, sunning themselves and conversing
throatily across the way, offered momentary interest;
but Clif would have preferred a wider outlook.
Besides, since the windows faced the east, the room
promised to be rather dark after midday. In fact,
away from the windows it was already shadowed.</p>

<p>In the shrubbery along the farther side of the courtyard
a gang of noisy sparrows were chasing each other
about, plump, truculent roisterers who squabbled and
fought for no apparent reason. Beyond them the ivy
along the lower wall of the three-story stone building
was still green and varnished looking. Some of the
ambitious tendrils were well above the second line of
windows over there. Clif’s gaze wandered toward the
front of the building and was captured by a moving
flash of color at an open window. It was a bit of
yellow silk curtain that swayed beyond the frame in
the stirring of a languid breeze. Clif was viewing that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
window at an angle, but the room beyond was flooded
by sunlight and so much of it as was within his range of
vision was visible in detail. He could see the end of
a couch tapestried in blue and brown, the corner of a
bookcase, a picture on a wall. But what interested him
far more was the object that occupied most of the foreground.</p>

<p>That object was his late adversary, Kemble. Even
across the width of the courtyard Clif read in attitude
and countenance dejection and perplexity. It wasn’t
difficult for the observer to complete the scene from
imagination. Kemble was seated at one side of a
table. Across from him, wearing, doubtless, a look
of stern yet patient displeasure, sat the Mr. Wyatt of
whom he had so feelingly spoken. In short, Clif was
viewing his enemy in the throes of an inquiry into his
knowledge of English!</p>

<p>For the moment Clif’s emotion was one of unmixed
delight. Retribution had overtaken the hated foe!
Then, however, his feeling of triumph waned—gave
way before a faint stirring of sympathy. Even if the
fellow was a blighter he deserved some pity under
such conditions, and, besides, simple <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
demanded that Clif should align himself on the side
of the oppressed fellow student rather than with that
enemy body the Faculty! For a minute longer he
looked and then turned away. To-morrow, he told
himself, he would hold Kemble to strict accountability,
but meanwhile he was “rooting” hard for that suffering
youth and for the confusion of the tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Away from the window, he gave his attention to the
room and its possibilities. It was furnished with two
metal beds, two fumed-oak chiffoniers, four chairs, of
which two were straight-backed and two of the variety
known as morris, and a good-sized study table. There
was, besides, a cushioned bench under each window.
The prevailing color was brown. The furniture was
dark brown, the walls were light brown and a heavy
brown linoleum covered the floor. On the latter were
spread three medium brown rugs with dark blue borders.
Only the ceiling of creamy white and the bedspreads
of a chalkier hue offered relief from the general
scheme. Even the side curtains at the windows
and the corduroy of the seat cushions were brown.
On the whole, though, the room was rather pleasing,
save for the single exception of lack of light, and, when
Clif had switched the electricity on, even that failing
disappeared. The two closets, one at each side of the
door, were of generous size and held such conveniences
as a shelf for shoes, a rod for hangers and a trousers
rack on the door. Oh, he guessed it wasn’t so bad,
after all!</p>

<p>And at the moment of reaching this conclusion there
was a commotion at the front of the building, telling
him that the first wholesale influx of students had
begun. There was the sound of voices, the <em>chug chugging</em>
of motors, the thud of bags. Then came the
shuffle of feet on the stone stairs, and laughter and
whistling. Clif turned off the illumination, wondering
if Walter Harrison Treat had arrived with the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
contingent. Naturally, he felt some curiosity about
Mr. Treat. There were voices in the corridor now,
and doors opened and banged shut. Clif retreated to a
window seat, took one foot in his hands—noting approvingly
that the brown leather shoe chimed in harmoniously
with the surroundings—and waited. Then
the door of Number 17 opened, swinging inward
leisurely and with a certain dignity, and the end of an
immaculate black suit case came into sight.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<small>GETTING ACQUAINTED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A boy of seventeen followed the suit case, and
the first occupant of Number 17 sighed with
relief. Walter Harrison Treat looked more
than possible as a roommate. He was fairly tall, rather
thin, wore excellent but unobtrusive clothes and observed
Clif with sober inquiry through a pair of spectacles.
Being made with a very light gold frame, the
spectacles were not especially apparent, and a second
relieved sigh escaped Clif. It would have been a horrible
thing had Treat worn those staring, tortoise-shell
contraptions. Clif was certain he could never live
through the school year with a pair of mandarin spectacles!</p>

<p>They shook hands, Clif with warmth, Walter with
a polite reserve that the other soon learned to be natural
with him. Then they talked, carefully avoiding
apparent interest in each other’s affairs. Even so,
however, certain facts regarding Walter were laid bare.
He lived in Boston. Well, not exactly <em>in</em> Boston, you
understand, but just outside; West Newton, to be exact.
This was his third year here. He had entered as a
Junior. Last year he had roomed in East Hall. He
thought he might like this better, as it seemed quieter.
Over there, the Juniors had the first and second floors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and were a noisy lot. He was a third classman this
year. By rights he should be in the second class, but
he had begun school late, owing to illness when he was
thirteen. What did Clif think of the school?</p>

<p>Presently they selected beds, closets, chiffoniers,
window seats and chairs at the study table, choosing
alternately after Clif, at Walter’s insistence, had spoken
first. Then Clif started unpacking, and Walter, whose
trunk had not yet arrived, took himself off to report at
the Office. Twenty minutes sufficed to transfer the
contents of trunk and bag to drawers and closet, and
then, since Walter had not returned, Clif slipped his
coat on again and went downstairs. The scene below
had changed since he had last viewed it. Boys congregated
thickly about the Office, wandered in and out of
the recreation room, and liberally sprinkled themselves
over the steps outside. Clif went out and perched himself
near the bottom of the flight. It was not so warm
now. He looked at his watch. Twenty minutes to
four. His father would be somewhere about Hartford,
he guessed; that is, barring trouble with that soft tire.
He hoped there had been no trouble, for his father
usually left tire changing to him. Clif smiled. He
guessed his father would make pretty hard work of
putting on a new tire! Then the smile faded. He was
going to miss his father a good deal, he told himself.
They had been together so much, that it seemed strange
to think that he wasn’t to see him again for a fortnight.
He guessed his father would miss him, too. Maybe it
was going to be harder for dad than for him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>He wondered why he had decided on Wyndham,
when there were so many schools near home which he
could have attended as a day student. Well, that was
just the reason, wasn’t it? They had both thought it
would be better if he went far enough away so that he
would get the benefit of school life. “You pick the
place yourself, son,” Mr. Bingham had said. “I don’t
care what the price is, only see that you get your
money’s worth.” And so, after months of indecision
during which he had perused a veritable library of
prospectuses and catalogues, Clif had chosen the John
Wyatt Wyndham Preparatory School for Boys for no
better reason than that while looking through the program
of last year’s Brown and Dartmouth game he
had paused at a half-tone picture of a clean, earnest
looking youth in football togs and idly read the lines
beneath it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“E. W. Langley, Jr., End. Class of 1923, age 21,
weight 169, height 5 ft. 11 in. Cooperstown, N. Y.
Prepared at Wyndham School.”</p>
</div>

<p>Clif had watched “Wuzzy” Langley play football,
and “Wuzzy” had become very close to hero size in
Clif’s estimation, and it seemed to him that a school
that could turn out fellows like “Wuzzy,” fellows who
played wonderful football and whose names were
synonymous with all that was clean and healthy and
manly, was exactly the school he was looking for.
That evening he told his father that he had decided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
on a school, and Mr. Bingham, after learning his reason
for choosing Wyndham, gravely agreed that he
had undoubtedly made a wise selection. If Mr. Bingham
was secretly amused he didn’t show it. So Clif
wrote for literature and studied it interestedly. Even
if the description and pictures sent to him had been
disappointing he would still have gone to Wyndham,
but they weren’t. On the contrary, what he read increased
his enthusiasm, and after that, until he received
assurance from “J. Coles, Secretary,” that he had been
admitted, he was on tenterhooks.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until close to the time for departure that
the thought of being separated from his father began
to dampen his pleasure of anticipation. There were
days, toward the last, when he would have backed down
had Mr. Bingham given him the slightest encouragement.
Keeping on at high school seemed plenty good
enough then. But Mr. Bingham kept on smiling cheerfully
and the fatal day grew nearer and nearer and—then
one September morning they were speeding off
in the car, Clif’s trunk in the tonneau, and the die was
cast.</p>

<p>Clif’s somewhat doleful reminiscences were broken
into by the tooting of a motor horn down the drive,
and a big blue bus rolled past to East Hall and disgorged
nearly a score of very small, very noisy boys.
“The infant class has arrived,” said a youth behind
Clif. A second bus paused at West Hall and a dozen
or so older fellows went crowding past, bag laden,
exchanging greetings. A load of trunks passed around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the side of the wing. The tall clock in the reception
room chimed out four o’clock. Another automobile,
a hired vehicle, crowded to the steps and four more
laughing, sun-browned fellows piled out of it and
dragged suit cases and bags to the gravel while one of
the number haggled amusingly with the driver. When
the new arrivals had disappeared inside Clif remembered
Kemble and wondered if that objectionable youth
had been released from his session with Mr. Wyatt,
and, if he had, whether he was even now preparing
for his exodus. Judging from the expression Clif had
seen on his face, Kemble’s chance of remaining at
Wyndham was mighty slim! Well, Clif guessed the
school would be well rid of him. Fellows who hadn’t
the common decency to mind their own affairs and—and
didn’t know any better than to sit and gloat over
another chap’s—another chap’s—well, embarrassment,
weren’t wanted at a school like Wyndham. No, sir!
Only—well, when you came to think of it, it was sort of
tough to get turned down like that. And the fellow was
kind of nice looking, too; and there had been something
about him. Sort of—sort of appealing. Or—or
something. Oh, well, Clif didn’t wish him any ill luck.
If they let him stay it wouldn’t make any difference to
Clif. There’d be room enough for both of them in a
school that looked after a hundred and ninety fellows!</p>

<p>Presently he got up and climbed the stairs again to
Number 17. Walter Treat’s trunk had arrived and he
was unpacking. Clif sat down on a window seat and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
watched. Walter was astonishingly methodical and
particular. It took him many minutes to dispose of a
couple of dozen collars to his liking in the left-hand
top drawer of his chiffonier, and he rearranged his five
pairs of shoes exactly three times along the bottom
shelf of his closet. Clif began to wonder if he was
going to like Walter Treat, after all. Conversation
was desultory, consisting mainly of questions from Clif
and answers from Walter. The latter was parsimonious
of information, then and ever after. It seemed to
be Walter’s philosophy to never offer anything not
asked for and then to give as little as possible of it.
But by dint of requestioning Clif managed to elicit
information regarding school customs and rules which
he stood in need of; information regarding the hours
for meals, the location of class rooms, the time of
rising and so on. With his father—they had reached
Freeburg at half-past twelve and had luncheon at the
Inn before proceeding to the school—Clif had been
conducted through the buildings by one of the faculty
and had everything shown and explained. But there
were certain details that Mr. Frost, Latin instructor
and Assistant to the Principal, had neglected, and it
was these that Clif now obtained, not without difficulty,
from Walter.</p>

<p>“What sort of a chap is this Mr. McKnight?” Clif
inquired. “He’s my adviser, you know.”</p>

<p>“‘Lovey’? Not a bad sort. He’s Chem.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but is he—is he a young man or a
fossil?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“About twenty-eight, I believe. Haven’t seen him
yet?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve got a date at seven-thirty to fix up my
schedule. I’m glad he’s youngish. And how about
Wyatt?”</p>

<p>“You won’t like him. ‘Alick’s’ a tartar. But you
won’t have him more than four hours a week. He’s
English Lit.”</p>

<p>“Do you have McKnight, too?”</p>

<p>“For adviser? No, ‘Cheese’ is my ‘nurse.’ He’s
French. You don’t have him until next year.”</p>

<p>“Is Cheese his real name, or—”</p>

<p>“Parks, Charles Parks. They call him ‘Charlie’
sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Do they all have pet names?” asked Clif.</p>

<p>“Naturally. There’s ‘Old Brad’ and ‘Lovey’ and
‘Pink’ and ‘Cocky’—and ‘Wim’—”</p>

<p>“Who’s ‘Cocky’?”</p>

<p>“Babcock, Physical Director and Hygiene. ‘Wim’s’
Head of the Junior School. It’s run separate, you
know. Then there’s ‘The Turk’ and—” But possibly
Walter realized that he was offering unsolicited information,
for he stopped short, selected a towel from a
neat pile in a lower drawer and made for the lavatory.
Clif hugged a knee and watched the shadows creep
across the courtyard. Life didn’t look promising to
him just then. This fellow Treat—well, Clif didn’t
believe he was going to find him just what his name
implied. Sort of a “frozen-face,” he seemed. Maybe
you were like that if you came from Boston. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
there had been a corking chap at the beach last month
who had hailed from the Hub, too. Too bad he wasn’t
to have Benson for a pal instead of Walter Treat.
Even that cheeky Kemble was more—more human,
Clif grudgingly acknowledged. He got up and sent a
difficult look toward Mr. Wyatt’s window. It was
empty now and the room was full of shadows. His
watch proclaimed four-forty. There remained, then,
an hour and twenty minutes before dinner—no, supper.
Funny scheme, having supper in the evening and dinner
at midday. He didn’t suppose he was going to like that
at first. Well, there were probably plenty of other
things he wouldn’t like any better! He guessed there
wasn’t any school that was as nice as a fellow’s own
home. Thinking of the square, brick house back in
Providence made him feel decidedly unhappy. Pretty
soon—well, not yet, but in another two or three hours—the
lights would come out all over the city, and from
the window of his room up there on the hill it was like
looking down on fairyland. Sophie would be trotting
to the front door about now, looking for the evening
paper. She always got it first and took it back to the
pantry and read the love story and the beauty hints
before any one else could get hold of it. And pretty
soon dad would come walking up the hill, the Boston
financial paper held in one gloved hand, his silver-knobbed
stick in the other—no, he wouldn’t either; not
this evening. Clif looked at his watch again. His
father ought to be somewhere around Willimantic now;
maybe further; he had a way of “stepping on it” when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the road was clear that was a caution! Clif wished
mightily that he was in that softly purring car this
minute!</p>

<p>Walter came back, looking annoyingly virtuous for
having washed up, and Clif said he guessed he’d walk
around a bit. He would have been glad if Walter had
offered to accompany him, as little as that youth’s
society would have appealed to him under other circumstances,
but Walter didn’t offer. He just said
“Yes,” in that irritatingly noncommittal way of his.
Clif took up his cap and went out and down the stairs
and so, presently, into the late sunshine. Well, it was
a heap better than that gloomy room, he told himself,
and the threatened attack of homesickness disappeared.
He walked down the drive and out at the wide gate at
the corner of the grounds and on to Oak Street. He
knew it was Oak Street because a neat sign told him
so. The village proper began a block south with comfortable
if unpretentious residences that presently
merged into the business district. The hotel, the Freeburg
Inn, at which they had eaten a very satisfactory
luncheon, was across the wide, elm-shaded street.
Beyond it was a short block of two-story brick store
buildings; a busy, modern looking drug store, a hardware
emporium with one window devoted to football
and other sporting goods, a dry goods store, a grocery
displaying a colorful array of canned fruit, a real-estate
and insurance office. There were more stores on
the other side, and then, at the corner, the Town Hall;
and the library beyond that, where the street branched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and a tiny patch of park surrounded a memorial fountain.
At the apex of the junction a small fire house
offered, through a wide doorway, an arresting glimpse
of red paint and shining brass. Clif paused to look
in at the apparatus, wondering why an alarm of fire
never came in while a fellow was on hand to get the
benefit of it! Beyond the fire house more residences
bordered the quiet stretch of recently sprinkled asphalt,
but they offered small interest to the boy and he crossed
to the other side of Oak Street and loitered back, stopping
before each window until he had exhausted its
possibilities for entertainment. He managed to kill
more than a half hour in this wise, and got back to
West Hall about half after five to find Number 17
empty and dark. The room, however, looked quite
cheerful after he had switched on the lights, and he
got a magazine he had brought with him and read
until a few minutes to six. He was still slicking down
his wet hair when a gong clanged thrice somewhere
below. He put out the lights and, suddenly aware of
a very healthy appetite, set out for the dining hall.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<small>“LOVEY” McKNIGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The dining hall occupied the ground floor of
the rear section of West Hall, a spacious room
of oak beams and rough gray plaster, of paneled
walls and many high windows. On either side,
like soldiers on parade, eight white-draped tables were
spaced. There was, also, a seventeenth table, but this
was in the corner beyond the door that led to Middle
Hall, and, whereas the other tables held twelve persons
each, the seventeenth accommodated only Doctor Wyndham;
Mr. Frost, his assistant; Miss Coles, the secretary;
and Mrs. Flood, Junior School matron. At the
head of each of the eight tables along the farther wall
sat a faculty member; in Wyndham School parlance,
a “fac”; and his surveillance included not only the
board at which he sat but also the one directly across
from it. Seats at tables bearing even numbers were
much sought after since those were the ones lacking,
as one might say, local government. Clif, though,
wasn’t aware of good fortune when he found himself
seated at Table 12; beyond, that is, the good fortune
of being provided a place where food was supplied.</p>

<p>There was nothing especially remarkable about any
of his table companions, he decided after furtive study.
Many of the eleven were of about his own age; three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
or four were older. One of the latter sat at the head
of the board, a broadshouldered, athletic-looking fellow
of possibly eighteen with good features and a
pleasant, crisp voice. He didn’t talk much, however.
Clif mentally catalogued him as a person of importance,
probably a football or crew captain. The boy
on his right was thin and nervous and ate a great deal.
The one on his left was neither thin nor nervous, but,
or so it seemed to Clif, equally heroic with the food.
Directly opposite sat a short youth with a large, square
head and hair that grew erect and was very thick and
coarse and black. This youth had table manners never
learned from any book of etiquette, Clif thought. It
was evident that the members of Table 12 were not
yet well acquainted, for conversation was neither general
nor frequent. Clif applied himself diligently to
the matter of satisfying his appetite, finding more food
than sufficient and of an excellent quality; then, having
finished, made his way out again.</p>

<p>His course took him around the end of Table 10,
and as he passed he was surprised to find himself
spoken to. “Hi, Bingham,” said a voice. Clif looked,
expecting to see Walter Treat, but the boy who had
spoken, seated at the farther side of the table, was
Kemble. He waved the half of a muffin and followed
his hail with: “Wait around, will you? I want to
speak to you.” Clif nodded and went on. So, it appeared,
Kemble had survived the ordeal after all!
Probably he wanted to arrange about that scrap in the
morning. Evidently he was a man of his word and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
didn’t intend to attempt a back-down. Clif followed
some other fellows along the corridor, past the reading
room and library on one side and the offices on the
other, and reached the recreation room. The place appeared
pretty well filled, but, after a moment’s hesitation
at the doorway, he saw that there were still
vacant seats along the leather-cushioned bench that followed
the walls from door to great stone fireplace. He
picked his way between the chattering groups and found
a place by one of the front windows and looked about
him.</p>

<p>The recreation room was a big square apartment
filled with chairs and couches and game tables. Already
several games of chess or checkers were in progress,
and Clif wondered how the players could put their
minds on their problems with such a din of talk and
laughter going on about them. There was one huge
table in the center of the room, and from it half a
dozen fellows swung their feet and took part in a loud
discussion with the occupants of several clustered chairs.
Clif couldn’t make out what the subject under consideration
was, because they all talked at once, but it was
undoubtedly important since several of the assemblage
were gesticulating excitedly and getting quite red of
face. Clif watched for a minute or two and then
turned his gaze to a checker battle being waged a few
feet distant between two absorbed and silent opponents.
He had become quite interested in it when some one
squeezed down beside him on the bench and claimed his
attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t have any luck,” announced Kemble.</p>

<p>“How do you mean? Aren’t you going to stay?”
Clif took pains to keep all trace of interest from his
voice.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” replied Kemble. “I am. Wyatt said he
ought to turn me down, but that that would be too easy
on me. Said he was going to pass me and devote the
next three years to letting light in on the dark places.
Or something insulting like that. Anyway, I’ve got
to stay.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you <em>want</em> to?” asked Clif, surprised.</p>

<p>Kemble shook his head gravely. “I don’t know. Of
course I did want to when I came, but Wyatt got me
scared so I was dead sure I couldn’t, and so I had it all
planned to go back home. And now he’s gone and
double-crossed me and I’ve got to—to readjust myself,
so to say. Isn’t that the dickens?”</p>

<p>Clif eyed the other suspiciously. “I guess you’ll live
through it,” he said coldly. “What class are you?”</p>

<p>“Third. You, too, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Clif nodded. “Funny you being shy on English.
The course doesn’t look hard in the catalogue.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t suppose it’s hard. I just never got up
much interest in those guys that wrote literature. I’m
pretty fair on math and Latin and history and the rest
of the junk, though. Well, I’ll just have to make the
best of it, I suppose. Got your schedule fixed up yet?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m to see Mr. McKnight at half-past seven.”</p>

<p>“We’ll probably get the same hours, mostly,” mused
Kemble. “Fellow sufferers, we twain!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, if you don’t want to study or anything, what
did you come here for?” demanded Clif impatiently.</p>

<p>“Thunder! You don’t suppose I came because I
wanted to, do you?” asked Kemble incredulously. “I
wanted to stay where I was, at Morristown. I was
dead sure of the First Team this fall, too, hang it!”</p>

<p>“Where’s Morristown, and what First Team do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“New Jersey, of course. High School Team. I’d
made the backfield certain if I’d been there. I nearly
did it last year.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can play football here, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you can jump out the third-story window,
but that doesn’t mean you’re going to fly! A swell
chance I’d have to make the team here, Bingham! Oh,
well!”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s just a question of playing well enough.
I’m going to try, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“That so? Played much? What school?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t played much, no,” answered Clif, “but I
mean to. I played on our Second Team last fall, but
just as a sub. I was too light. I’ve put on eight or
ten pounds since then, though.”</p>

<p>“Back?”</p>

<p>“End.”</p>

<p>“Half back’s mine. Still, I’d play—play center if
they’d let me! Best you and I’ll make, though, is a
class team or a hall team, or whatever they have here.
Well, if the old high school gets licked this year it’ll
be Wyatt’s fault.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Clif laughed, and then, remembering that here was
an enemy, he froze up quickly. “I guess it would
worry him to know that,” he remarked with immense
sarcasm. “Look here, Kemble, how about to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow?” Kemble looked blank.</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow,” answered Clif sternly. “You
needn’t pretend you’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that! I really had forgotten, though; give you
my word, Bingham. Why, any time you say. That
is, if you really want to go on with it.”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” answered Clif emphatically. “Unless,”
he added after an instant, “you care to apologize.”
He hoped, when he had said it, that his tone hadn’t
sounded as eager to Kemble as it had to him!</p>

<p>“Apologize? Sure! Why not?” replied the other
readily. “That’s much the best way, eh? You know,
I’m about a dozen pounds heavier than you, old scout,
and a couple of inches taller, too, and I guess—here,
put your arm out.” Clif obeyed and Kemble tucked
his fingers under the other’s armpit. “Just as I thought.
I can outreach you by two inches.”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference,” declared Clif warmly.
“You said you’d fight me—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” broke in Kemble soothingly, “but
I’ve apologized, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t. You merely said you were willing
to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gosh, why the formality? All right, though.
I apologize, Bingham, for—I say, what the dickens <em>do</em>
I apologize for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>His perplexity was so genuine that Clif’s severity
relaxed in spite of himself. It was, he decided, no use
trying to stay angry with this chap, and having reached
that decision he felt much relieved, and laughed frankly
at the puzzled Kemble. Whereupon Kemble’s brow
cleared and he grinned back.</p>

<p>“You’re a perfect ass,” declared Clif indulgently.</p>

<p>“No one is perfect,” Kemble demurred modestly,
“although some of us do come pretty close.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, you were a good deal of a rotter to
sit there and—and make fun—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was, Bingham, and I’m sorry. I apologize,
honestly. It isn’t much of an excuse, I know, but—but
I wasn’t feeling very chipper myself.”</p>

<p>Clif nodded. Kemble, of course, was referring to
that session with Mr. Wyatt. Then:</p>

<p>“Maybe,” added Kemble more constrainedly, “I’ll
tell you about it some time.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Clif, for want of anything better. Kemble
was staring frowningly at the nearby checker board.
Observing him, Clif sensed a matter more serious than
the recent English quiz. A silence that might have
become slightly awkward in another moment was dispelled
by the golden tones of the clock across the corridor.
They reached Clif even above the noise of the
room, and he sprang to his feet. “Gee! Seven-thirty!
I’ve got to beat it, Kemble. Listen; I—”</p>

<p>“Go ahead. I’m with you.”</p>

<p>In the corridor, where half a dozen boys were awaiting
their turns at the telephone booths outside the Office,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Kemble said, “Look for me in Assembly Hall at eight,
eh? I’ll stick around the door.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” agreed Clif, making for the stairs.
“Wear a red carnation, will you?”</p>

<p>Kemble grinned and waved.</p>

<p>Although Clif reached his appointment several minutes
late he had to wait several more minutes while
Mr. McKnight disposed of a previous visitor, and he
used the time in making an interested and approving
examination of his surroundings. There were four
faculty suites in each of the two dormitory buildings,
and Mr. McKnight occupied Number 19, W., just
around the corner from Clif’s room. Number 19, however,
didn’t resemble Number 17 much. The study
was a big, nearly square room with windows on two
sides. Back of it, visible between parted draperies of
dark blue, was the bedroom, and from that opened a
bathroom of white tiling and gleaming nickel. But it
was the study that enthralled Clif. Everything about
it was so homelike and jolly. There was a small grand
piano by the nearer window with a gorgeous silk prayer
rug laid across it. Before the fireplace ran a huge
couch that simply begged to be lolled in, and there was
a shaded light behind one corner, in exactly the right
place for reading. Rugs covered the floor, pictures—good
ones, too, Clif was certain—peered down from
the pleasant dimness of paneled walls, bookcases flanked
the chimney. Here and there a deep chair; its leather
cushion a mite shabby from honorable service, held
forth inviting arms. Beside one, on a low stand, lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
a blackened pipe, a magazine, opened face-down, and
a heavy brass paper knife. For the first time Clif discerned
advantages in the profession of pedagogy. If a
fellow could live in a room like this, why, gee, teaching
wouldn’t be so bad!</p>

<p>Mr. McKnight sat at the farther side of a desk table,
the light from a green-shaded lamp cutting him off at
the top button of his waistcoat and leaving his face in
mellow shadow. But when Clif had taken the chair
across the polished expanse of mahogany surface the
instructor’s countenance was plainly visible. Mr.
McKnight was the youngest member of the faculty,
being but twenty-eight. Although his first name was
Godfrey, he was popularly known as “Lovey.” The
reason was obscure. Some said that he had brought
the nickname with him from college, others that it had
been conferred upon him after he had arrived at Wyndham,
but none could say why. Clif didn’t consider that
the name suited. In the first place, “Lovey” was rather
a large man, dark haired, keen eyed and deep voiced;
and, after that, there was nothing at all effeminate in
his manner nor affectionate in the tone in which he
had bade Clif exchange the chair by the door for that
at the table.</p>

<p>“Your name’s Clifton Bingham,” said Mr. McKnight
briskly. “You’re in the Third Class.”</p>

<p>Clif assented, watching the instructor take a gray
oblong of cardboard from a drawer and begin to write
on it. The writing was small and extremely neat and
legible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“You have five prescribed courses in this term, of
a total of eighteen hours, Bingham, as I presume you
know. I include Hygiene, two hours, and I mention
it because formerly one didn’t get it until Second Class
year.” His pen moved rapidly and certainly. “There
are two other courses open to you, either of which you
may elect if you care to. They’re both ‘snap’ courses,
you know, Bingham, and won’t strain you any. But
if I were you I’d leave them alone this year; at least
until the next term. I find that you chaps have plenty
of work if you do it right. All right. Now about
athletics.” Mr. McKnight laid his pen down, pushed
the gray card aside and folded his hands. “Anything
in that line appeal to you?”</p>

<p>“I’m going out for football, sir,” said Clif.</p>

<p>“Good. You understand that regular participation
in some recognized sport is demanded, and that in any
case you are required to attend gymnasium classes unless
excused by the Physical Instructor, Mr. Babcock.
If you are taken permanently on to one of the football
squads you won’t have to bother with gym stuff for
a while. See Mr. Babcock to-morrow, by the way.
You’ll find him in his office in the gymnasium from
nine to twelve. Or you can get him at his study in
East Hall, probably. Better look this over and then
put it somewhere where you can refer to it until you’ve
got your hours memorized.”</p>

<p>He indicated the schedule and Clif picked it up and,
after a somewhat vague examination, placed it in a
pocket. Mr. McKnight asked about his roommate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
about his football experience and about himself, and
Clif gradually sank back against the chair and felt
more at ease. Mr. McKnight leaned back, too, and
listened and watched. Clif told about Providence and
high school and his father and, before he realized it,
how he had decided on Wyndham School. Mr. McKnight
chuckled then, but it was a genial, understanding
sort of chuckle, and Clif smiled in response, and
after that the instructor didn’t seem so awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>“That,” said Mr. McKnight, “reminds me of the
story of the boy whose father and mother wanted him
to go to college but who wasn’t keen on it himself. His
father wanted Jack to go to Princeton and his mother
wanted him to go to Harvard. (You can swap the
names around to suit yourself, Bingham. I’m a Princeton
man, and I’m telling it the Princeton way.) Jack
didn’t care where he went, you understand, and so,
after his parents had argued the matter for weeks, he
said, ‘Tell you what, Dad. I’ll toss a coin. If it comes
down heads, you win and I go to Princeton. If it
comes down tails, Ma wins and I go to Harvard.’ So
they agreed and Jack tossed up a quarter and when it
fell and stopped rolling, there it was leaning up against
the leg of a chair, straight on edge! Jack took a look
at it and kicked it down the register. ‘It’s a “dud.”
I’ve got to go to Yale!’”</p>

<p>Clif laughed, but not so heartily as he might have
if he had not at that period been vacillating between
Yale and Brown as a scene for future scholastic and
athletic triumphs!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. McKnight said, “I’d like to
remind you, Bingham, that an adviser is one who supplies
advice. Most fellows think his business is only
to get them out of trouble. Well, I’m always glad to
do all I can in that way, but you chaps ought to remember
that prevention is better than cure and that if you
come here for advice you’re not likely to come back
later for help. Just bear that in mind, won’t you? And
bear in mind that I’ve been through just what you and
all the rest of you are going through—and not so long
ago, either—and know pretty well what your problems
and temptations are. So don’t think I’m no use to you
except to advise you about your studies. Studies,
school work, are a small part of your life here. The
real problems and the biggest worries are likely to concern
your relationship with your fellows, your attitude
toward the school, your social and athletic interests.
Very often the smallest problems are the hardest to
solve, Bingham. Well, when you run up against something
that you can’t settle to your own satisfaction come
and see me and we’ll talk it over. Maybe we’ll find
the answer that way, maybe we won’t; but it always
helps to talk it over. Sort of blows the fog away.
You’ll find me here in the evenings, generally, and
always between five and six. And that reminds me:
Friday evenings, after study hour, we get together here
and have a sort of quiet shindig; talk a good deal, have
a little music, maybe, and get acquainted. Not much
in the way of excitement, you know, but usually a
pleasant time is had by all. Drop in as often as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
can, Bingham, and bring a friend with you.” Mr.
McKnight glanced at his watch. “You’ve just time
to make assembly hall before the fun starts. Good
night. Drop in often, Bingham. You don’t have to
wait for a Friday evening, you know.”</p>

<p>Traversing the dimly lighted corridor of Middle
Hall, past the gloomy caverns of the darkened class
rooms, Clif was sensible of a new cheerfulness. The
echoes aroused by the brisk tramp of his feet on the
old, worn floor sounded almost friendly to him.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>A BOY IN A WHEEL CHAIR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">To reach the assembly hall, which occupied the
entire first floor rear section of East Hall,
just as the dining hall occupied the same location
on the other side, Clif had to go the length of
Middle Hall, pass into the wider corridor of the newer
building beyond, turn left and follow the main corridor
to the staircase. East Hall, save for a dozen rooms
on the third floor, was devoted principally to the use
of the Junior School, composed of boys between the
ages of eleven and fourteen. Mr. Clendenin, known
as “Wim” because of his invariable custom of signing
himself “Wm. Clendenin,” was at the head. The
Juniors had their own parlor, recreation room, library,
reading room, game room and office on the ground
floor. They ate, however, in the dining hall in West
and shared the class rooms in Middle with the older
students. Middle, once containing all there was of the
school, had long since been remodeled into class rooms
only.</p>

<p>Doctor Wyndham, the Principal, occupied a suite of
three rooms and bath on the second floor of East Hall.
Other suites, smaller, similar to Mr. McKnight’s, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
situate in each of the newer buildings, and accommodated
fourteen faculty members.</p>

<p>Clif descended the stairway to the first floor corridor.
At the far end the vicinity of the assembly hall
entrance was crowded with boys who, waiting outside
until the last moment, had now begun to crowd through
the wide doorway. Clif concluded that he was the last
one to arrive, but he wasn’t, since, as he passed the open
door of a room beyond Mr. Clendenin’s office, he was
obliged to step quickly aside to avoid collision with a
wheel chair which, emerging noiselessly on rubber tires,
had given him no warning. The chair was occupied
by a boy a year or so Clif’s senior. A dark plaid rug
covered the lower part of his body. On a shelf stretched
between the chair arms lay a book and a fountain pen.
The occupant of the chair propelled it by the wheels,
turning it deftly to avoid Clif and directing it along the
corridor toward assembly hall. He smiled an apology
as he did so. Noting that he was obliged to lean forward
slightly to grasp the wheels, or, rather, a rim that
projected from them for the purpose of propulsion,
Clif said impulsively:</p>

<p>“Let me be chauffeur, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The boy in the chair looked back and smiled again.
“Why, thanks. I’m just going to the assembly hall,
and it really isn’t hard, but if you don’t mind giving
me a shove—”</p>

<p>“Glad to,” said Clif heartily.</p>

<p>By the time they had reached the door the throng
had thinned to a few embarrassed, giggling juniors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
and, at the other’s request, Clif wheeled the chair just
inside the portal. Doctor Wyndham was already on
the platform and the fellows were clapping loudly. The
boy in the chair smiled his thanks and Clif tiptoed
across to Tom, who had saved a seat for him in the
rear row.</p>

<p>“Who’s that fellow?” asked Tom in whispers.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I met him in the corridor.” Then,
as the applause ceased, Clif gave his attention to the
speaker. Doctor Wyndham was a tall, erect man of
sixty who looked rather more like a successful business
executive than a school principal. His hair, of which
he had managed to retain a goodly amount, was scarcely
more than grizzled, and his healthily tanned skin spoke
of fine physical condition. He was extremely good
looking and very distinguished appearing, and the
School was proud of him. That he was the business
man as well as the pedagogue was proved by the institution
of which he was the head and owner. In the
brief space of twenty-four years he had built it up from
nothing to one of the finest and best-known preparatory
schools of the east. The Doctor had been a widower
for many years and was without children. It was
believed that, at his death, the school would go to Mr.
Wyatt, his nephew.</p>

<p>He had a wonderfully clear and resonant voice and
enunciated each word so distinctly that, listening, one
was likely to lose the matter of his discourse in the
enjoyment of his delivery. Something of that sort
occurred to Clif, for when the frequent patter of applause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
broke in on the pleasant flow he usually discovered
that he didn’t know what the speaker had just
said. Then, too, the boy in the wheel chair interested
Clif. He stole frequent glances across and wondered
a good deal about him. He looked remarkably healthy,
with a good deal of color in his cheeks and plenty of
sparkle in his dark eyes. His hair was dark, too, almost
black, it seemed, and was brushed straight back from
a high forehead which, aided by a straight nose and a
slightly pointed chin, made Clif think of the Flaxman
profiles of ancient Greek heroes. A handsome fellow,
Clif decided, and attractive. He had frequently heard
the word magnetic used in reference to persons, but
this was the first time it had ever occurred to him as
appropriate. He concluded that he would rather like
to know the boy in the chair.</p>

<p>The Principal’s talk was a good deal like a dozen or
more other talks he had made on similar occasions.
There was a welcome to the new students, a greeting
to the old ones, much sensible advice on many subjects,
a reference to athletics—and especially football, a touch
of humor here and there and, at the last, an appeal to
his hearers for a conscientious performance of their
duties to themselves, their parents and the School.
Outside, Clif hazarded the opinion that it had been a
mighty fine talk, hoping that Tom wouldn’t call on him
to prove it by quotations. Tom said: “Yes, but I
didn’t get much of it. Let’s go over to the big city and
buy some peanuts or something, Bingham. I’m
starved!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>“Will they let us?”</p>

<p>“Why not? There’s no study hour to-night. Anyway,
we won’t be gone more than ten minutes.”</p>

<p>There was a light behind the windows of Number
17 West as they passed the courtyard, and Clif pictured
Walter Harrison Treat up there rearranging his
shoes for the fourth time and chuckled. Kemble asked
what the joke was and Clif explained. Kemble declared
that Treat must be a pill, adding: “I wish you
and I had got together, Bingham. I’m with a Second
Class fellow named Desmond, Billy Desmond. Not a
bad sort, but a bit snifty because he’s been around here
a couple of years.”</p>

<p>“I guess Treat feels sort of superior for the same
reason,” mused Clif.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be harsh with Desmond, because
he’s a First Team man; plays tackle, I think; and he
might be useful. I say, you’re going out for practice
to-morrow, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I haven’t heard anything about it, but I suppose
they want candidates.”</p>

<p>“Of course they do. Did you bring togs?”</p>

<p>“Some old ones. I’ll get others if—it’s worth
while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll get to play somewhere. Desmond says
there’s a lot of rivalry amongst the class teams. And
then there’s the scrub, too.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be lucky to make that, I guess. The fellows
here look awfully big and husky, Kemble.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s a guy at my table who must be nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
if he’s a day, and if he doesn’t top six feet I’ll eat
my hat! Say, I wonder if we can’t fix it to get together
in dining hall. Suppose they’ll let us? I’ll find out
to-morrow. There’s a fruit store over there, and I
think I smell peanuts!”</p>

<p>Going back, Kemble explained, while he cracked peanuts
steadily, that he hadn’t been able to do very well
at supper. “Mental exhaustion, you know. I was all
in when Wyatt let me go. I ought to hate that guy,
but I don’t seem to. He surely handed me some hot
ones, but I guess I deserved them. What’s the good
of knowing so blamed much about the queers who
wrote books a couple of hundred years ago? Heck,
it’s all I can do to half keep track of the guys who are
doing it now! Wyatt asked me to tell him what I knew
about Scott, and I said he was a mighty clever shortstop,
but I didn’t know his batting average. But,
gosh, he wasn’t talking baseball, he was talking about
the fellow who wrote ‘Ivanhoe’!”</p>

<p>“I saw you from my window when you were making
some of those brilliant sallies,” laughed Clif, “and you
certainly did look unhappy, Kemble!”</p>

<p>“I was! Say, drop the ‘Kemble,’ will you? I’m
generally called Tom.”</p>

<p>“I like Tom better. My name’s Clif, short for
Clifton.”</p>

<p>“I know. I heard your father call you that. That’s
a real classy name.”</p>

<p>Clif reflected that he hadn’t thought of his father
for a long while, and felt sort of guilty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“Not much style to Thomas,” the other was continuing.
“My middle name’s Ackerman. That was
my mother’s before she married. When I was a kid
I used to write my name T. Ackerman Kemble, but the
fellows got on to it and called me Tackerman, and
then Tak. Mother used to call me Tommy, but I had
to lick a chap in school for doing it. It was all right
from her, but I couldn’t stand for it generally.”</p>

<p>“Is your mother—I mean—”</p>

<p>“Yes, she died about six years ago. A man named
Winslow is my guardian. Mother didn’t have any
near relatives and this guy was her lawyer and so she
stung me with him. He’s sort of a pill. I say, pipe
the faculty chap on the steps!”</p>

<p>Against the light of West Hall entrance a tall figure
was darkly silhouetted as they came up the drive.</p>

<p>“Faculty chaps are bad luck for me,” confided Tom;
“like black cats!” Clif laughed uneasily. Then they
were at the steps and he said “Good evening, sir,” as
pleasantly as he knew how.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” was the response. “Where have
you boys been?”</p>

<p>“Just looking around, sir,” answered Tom promptly.</p>

<p>“What have you there?” The man indicated Tom’s
right hand. Tom looked and replied affably: “A peanut,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Hm. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Kemble, sir.”</p>

<p>“And yours?”</p>

<p>“Bingham, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Kemble and Bingham, it’s contrary to rules
to go off the grounds after six o’clock. You didn’t,
I presume, pick that peanut off any of the trees here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” answered Tom. “I rather think they
grow on vines.”</p>

<p>“Your knowledge of agriculture is impressive.”
Tom thought the instructor’s features relaxed a trifle,
but since they were in shadow he couldn’t be certain.
“You boys had better report to Mr. Frost in the morning,”
he went on. “Tell him Mr. Waltman sent you;
and why.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Tom politely. Then, as Mr. Waltman
ascended the steps and disappeared inside the Hall,
he added sadly: “Heck! This is a fine start, isn’t it?
Something tells me, Clif, that I’m not going to like this
place!”</p>

<p>Clif went up to Number 34 with Tom and met the
“snifty” roommate and liked him a lot. Billy Desmond
was a large, good-hearted and generally smiling
fellow of seventeen. Perhaps he was rather inclined
just at first to use a patronizing tone with Tom and
Clif, but he got over it before many days had passed
and was voted a good scout by both of them. To-night
he joked them a lot about their mishap and drew
lugubrious pictures of the Assistant to the Principal,
Mr. Frost, and described a variety of dire results any
one of which might befall them. Even though he discounted
Billy’s predictions Tom was characteristically
pessimistic and frequently reiterated his conviction that
he wasn’t going to be happy at Wyndham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Although on the third floor and on the opposite side
of the building from Clif’s room, Number 34 was a
replica of it. The only noticeable difference was in
the amount of floor space. Number 34 seemed smaller.
But Clif soon saw that this was due to a leather couch
which, at present occupied by Billy, thrust out from
the end of the study table like a sore thumb. It had a
history, that couch. Billy had bought it last term from
a departing owner who, in turn, had purchased it three
years before from some one else. Beyond that point it
could not be traced, but it looked every day of twenty
years! Its brown leather covering was missing in
many places and torn in others, and wherever this was
the case the stuffing of tow protruded pathetically. It
had been tufted at one time, but the buttons had long
since disappeared. While it probably retained the same
number of springs with which it had started, most of
them had ceased functioning. A few had not, however,
and it was those few which made it extremely difficult
for the stranger to occupy the couch with any degree of
comfort. They stuck up at unexpected places and, in
collusion with the slippery surface of the well-worn
leather, had deposited many an unwary visitor on the
floor. But Billy was very fond of that relic, very
proud of it, and was still convinced that when he had
exchanged three dollars and twenty-five cents for it he
had consummated a master stroke of finance. With
the aid of two faded, lumpy pillows—thrown in with
the couch for good measure—he occupied a sort of
trough down the center of the antiquity and, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
desk light conveniently near, could read or study at
ease. Just now, of course, he was doing neither.</p>

<p>“You fellows want to see ‘Cocky’ in the morning
and take your physical exams. If you don’t you can’t
turn out for practice. You play football, too, I suppose,
Bingham?” Billy gave Clif an appraising look
that held approval. Clif was tall for his sixteen years
and, although lacking weight, didn’t look stringy. Of
course, Billy reflected, he wasn’t First Team material
yet, but he looked promising. He seemed alert and
might be fast. Billy liked his clean-cut features, and
the way his face lighted when he smiled. Rather the
sort of fellow, he imagined, who would get along fast
and make a name for himself at Wyndham.</p>

<p>“You won’t get much more than a lot of hard work
this year,” Billy continued when Clif had replied affirmatively.
He was addressing them both, however.
“But you’ll be mighty glad next year that you had it.
That is, you will if you take your medicine and don’t
quit because you can’t be bloomin’ heroes the first
thing! That’s going to be your trouble, likely, Tom.
You’ll go off half-cocked some day and resign because
the coach doesn’t pat you on the back.”</p>

<p>“How do you get that way?” asked Tom indignantly.
“Don’t you suppose they play football anywhere but
here? I’ve played since I was twelve, and I’ve never
quit yet, and I’ve had some raw deals, too!”</p>

<p>Billy laughed. “You’re going to be a lot of fun for
me this year, Tom,” he said. “You’ve got quite a lot
of new stuff, son.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>“Huh!” Tom regarded his roommate doubtfully.
Then he grinned. “It’s going to be fifty-fifty, I guess.
I’m not the only funny one in this room.”</p>

<p>“Good lad,” approved Billy.</p>

<p>They talked football for a while and Billy told about
last year and how Wolcott had turned the tables in the
last quarter of the big game and turned a Wyndham
victory into a devastating defeat. “We had them all
the way until the tag end of that period. We’d scored
in the first and second, and booted a goal each time.
It was all over but the shouting, you might have
thought, for 14 to 3—they’d snitched a field-goal in
the third—was good enough for any one, and all we
had to do was hold them for the rest of the game.
Then they put this chap Grosfawk in at end. No one
had ever heard of him before around here. Our scouts
didn’t even remember his name. They had the ball
down on their thirty, and there was less than five minutes
of the game left. Their inside half, Cummins,
faked a kick and tossed to this Grosfawk chap, who
had managed to sneak pretty well across the field. It
wasn’t an awfully long throw, and he made it slow and
sure. Grosfawk was just about even with the scrimmage
line when he caught and when we’d nailed him
he was three yards from our goal-line. He’d run about
sixty-five yards, and there wasn’t a fellow on our team
who could lay claim to having touched him! Dodge?
That boy invented it! And he can run like a jack
rabbit. He’s a wonder, and why Wolcott didn’t find
it out before that game is more than I know!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“Did they make the touchdown?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, it took them four downs, but they finally got
the ball over, and that put the score 14 to 10. We still
thought we had the game, and we played for time and
stalled all they’d let us. But, shucks, that Grosfawk
didn’t know he was licked. Of course we laid for him
and he got used sort of hard, but with only a couple
of minutes left we didn’t pay so much attention to him
as we should have. So what does he do but pull the
same stunt? This time he only had about fifty yards
to go, and we made him earn them by chasing him back
and forth across the field two or three times. I nearly
had him once myself. So did most of the others. He
got tired of reversing the field after a while. Maybe
he was afraid the whistle might go off by accident
before he got the touchdown. Anyway, he streaked
it through our whole bunch just when it seemed we
had him, with two or three of his team interfering by
then, and dodged our quarter and went over right
between the posts. Well, that spilled the beans good
and plenty. Why, we had that old game in our pocket
five minutes before! We—we’d even spent it! I guess
we were just about the sorriest, saddest, most disgustedest
bunch you ever saw that evening!”</p>

<p>Tom chuckled. “Good thing for you fellows Bingham
and I came along, I guess. You need some one
to look after you and see that those naughty Wolcott
boys don’t steal your games. Mighty lucky, I’d say,
they didn’t take the uniforms off you fellows when
you weren’t looking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“You’re a cheeky cuss,” said Billy, but he laughed.
“Well, that’s the way the battle was fit, fellows. This
year ‘G.G.’ will probably detail a couple of fellows to
do nothing but watch Mr. Grosfawk. If he ever gets
loose, good-by, game!”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle,” said Tom. “The guy’s good, I dare
say, but you fellows let him hypnotize you. It takes
more than one player, no matter how good he is, to win
a game. All you’ve got to do this year is break up
their passing game. You must have had a slow bunch,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Tom,” said Billy, shaking his head, “you’re a great
little know-it-all. You come around and tell me all that
again in a couple of months and maybe I’ll believe it.
There’s the gong, Bingham. Better beat it. Good
night. See you again soon, I hope.”</p>

<small>OUT FOR THE TEAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Despite Tom’s forebodings the interview
with Mr. Frost went off quite pleasantly the
next morning. The Principal’s assistant
was rather bald and wore thick-lensed spectacles, but
he was quite a young man and did not strive to appear
otherwise. He seemed more amused than pained by
the explanation of the visit.</p>

<p>“Tough luck, boys, to buck the rules the first night
of the term!” he commented. “Of course you knew
you shouldn’t do it?”</p>

<p>Clif assured him he hadn’t known it, and Mr. Frost—“Homer”
the school called him, that being his given
name—turned to a page in a blue-covered booklet,
placed a finger half-way down it and invited Clif to
read. It was there, as plain as daylight, and Clif, who
had perused that volume thoroughly, as he thought,
couldn’t understand how he had missed it. As for
Tom, the latter explained cheerfully that he had only
looked at the pictures! Mr. Frost gravely presented
each of them with a copy of the booklet, advising them
to become better acquainted with the school regulations,
and dismissed them smilingly.</p>

<p>Returning to West Hall, Clif made fun of his companion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
for having been so pessimistic last evening.
Tom grinned. “There’s something wrong with that
fellow,” he answered. “He won’t be here long. You
mark my words, Clif. He’s too easy!”</p>

<p>That first day was devoted principally to preparing
for future labor. He and Tom visited several class
rooms and listened to instructions and made notes.
They bought books and stationery. They also visited
Mr. Babcock, the Physical Director, in the gymnasium,
which stood a few rods back of East Hall, and underwent
tests. Since there were at least a dozen other
fellows waiting, “Cocky” put them through expeditiously,
handed each a small card bearing his name and
a lot of figures and dismissed them. Then came dinner,
followed by another visit to Middle where, in Room
H, they listened while Mr. Waltman explained what a
beautiful thing was the Science of Mathematics and
how much pleasure could be derived from the study
of it, if they would but realize it. “The Turk” also
dwelt at some length on the results that might accrue
to them if they didn’t realize it! Tom, who had taken
a dislike to the instructor since last evening, made sarcastic
comments under his breath and caricatured “The
Turk” on the back of a blue book. Finally, having
obediently taken note of to-morrow’s lesson, they were
released. Going out, Clif glimpsed the wheel chair and
its occupant rolling along the corridor toward East
Hall. He had encountered them several times before
during the day. Evidently, he concluded, the fellow
was Third Class, too. He spoke to Tom about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what class he is,” said Tom, “but his
name’s Deane. I heard a chap call him that this morning.
Get your togs and wait for me down front. I
won’t be more than a minute.”</p>

<p>They obtained adjoining lockers in the gymnasium
and changed into football attire. Then, since they were
early for practice, they snooped around the building,
upstairs and down. The gymnasium was new and well
appointed. The floor was large enough for two basketball
games to be played at once, there was a good running
track above, and, occupying the second story of
the wing, a rowing room and two other apartments
variously used for fencing, boxing, wrestling and possibly
other sports. Underneath was a large baseball
cage and a dressing room for visiting teams. The
basement, which was half above ground and well
lighted, held the lockers, a swimming pool, shower
baths and the trainer’s quarters. On the main floor,
near the front entrance, Mr. Babcock had his office.</p>

<p>There were numerous trophies to be viewed and a
wealth of pictures hung about the halls and rooms,
most of the latter group photographs of teams and
crews of former years. Here and there, however, was
to be seen a picture of a football game or a view of a
crew race. “‘1919—Wyndham 16—Wolcott 0,’” read
Tom. “Huh! ‘1917—Wyndham by Seven Lengths.’
Say, it’s a funny thing you can’t find any photographs
where we were licked!”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Clif, “here’s a football game we
only tied. ‘Wyndham 7—Wolcott 7,’ it says.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“That must have got hung up by mistake! But it’s
a pretty nifty gym, just the same. Let’s go and see
what the field’s like.”</p>

<p>Wyndham School had almost outgrown its athletic
field, but the fact wasn’t apparent to Clif and Tom as
they left the gymnasium and started across the grass
toward the football gridiron. The farther line of the
school property was indicated by a soldierly array of
tall poplars. Against them, almost directly across from
the gymnasium, was a commodious concrete stand.
The quarter-mile track was in front, inclosing the First
Team gridiron. Another pair of goals, farther away,
provided a field for the second squad, while what was
known as the class field lay, somewhat cramped, behind
the school halls. There were two diamonds, although
in the fall the Second Team gridiron infringed on the
more distant one. A brook flowed across one corner
of the property and had been dammed to make a sizable
pond well south of the running track. In winter the
pond supplied skating facilities and sufficient surface
for two rinks, but at other seasons its usefulness was
not so evident. When the soccer team played on the
small expanse of turf awarded to them the small punt
now moored to a stake was occupied by some Junior
School volunteer whose duty was to recover errant
balls from the placid surface of the pond.</p>

<p>There was only a handful of candidates present when
Clif and Tom reached the shade of the covered grandstand
and the latter clumped their way to a couple of
seats and awaited the beginning of practice. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
a warm afternoon, with but little air stirring, and,
although Freeburg was set well amongst the lesser
slopes of the Berkshires, that air was decidedly humid.
Tom mopped his forehead with the sleeve of a brown
jersey and then tried to fan himself with an ancient
headguard. “Hope the coach doesn’t give us much to
do,” he muttered. “It’s too hot for football.”</p>

<p>“You might suggest it to him,” answered Clif. “I
guess that’s he now; the man in the white shirt.”</p>

<p>Tom looked and said he guessed so, too, but he didn’t
leave his seat to offer the coach any advice. A more
self-assured fellow than Tom would have hesitated to
approach “G.G.” on any matter not vitally important.
“G.G.’s” name was George G. Otis. Some said the
second “G” stood for “Grumpy,” but it really didn’t.
It stood for Gray. Mr. Otis wasn’t very large—Captain
Dave Lothrop, beside him, was four inches taller
and quite as wide of shoulders; and even the long
trousers of faded gray flannel didn’t wholly conceal the
fact that he was slightly bowlegged. But there was
plenty of body there, and the fact that his legs weren’t
quite straight hadn’t kept him from winning a fair
share of fame as a plunging half not many years back.
He hadn’t greatly distinguished himself while at Wyndham,
but his subsequent career had been linked with two
football teams by which all later teams at his college
were judged. He had a rather bullet-shaped head, with
thin hair of a faded brown, sharp eyes of a brown that
wasn’t the least bit faded, a short nose a bit too flat for
beauty, a mouth that closed tight and straight and an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
aggressive chin. On the whole he wasn’t an Apollo.
But he knew a lot of football and could teach it to boys;
and teaching football to boys is a different and much
harder task than teaching it to men.</p>

<p>“G.G.” didn’t seek popularity, and so he won it. He
was a hard taskmaster, could act the tyrant on occasion
and had a sharp, harsh tongue. He insisted on absolute
obedience and had been known to use drastic
methods to enforce discipline. He was sometimes intensely
disliked by those who didn’t share his views on
the necessity for obedience. But he was fair, could
laugh as heartily as any one, off the field, and never
made the mistake, a too common one, of expecting boys
of preparatory school age to think or perform like collegians.
Best of all, perhaps, from the point of view
of the School, was the fact that during his three years
as coach at Wyndham his charges had won twice from
Wolcott. That was almost enough to account for popularity,
but I think that there was another reason for
it. Boys have a respect for despotism and a liking for
being firmly ruled just so long as they are certain that
the despotism is just and the ruler is worthy. And as
a despot George G. Otis would have satisfied the most
demanding!</p>

<p>Tom, after looking the coach over exhaustively from
the distance of some ten yards, said “Huh!” in a very
doubtful tone. After a moment he said “Huh!” again,
and this time it seemed to express conviction. It did,
for he followed it with: “Something tells me, Clif, I’m
not going to like that guy! He—he’s got a bad eye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The gathering in front of the stand increased rapidly,
while the stand itself began to fill along its front seats
with spectators. Mr. Hilliard, Instructor in Modern
Languages, who was also assistant coach, joined the
throng by the bench. The trainer, Dan Farrell, a short,
chunky man with a round, good-natured countenance
and sharp blue eyes, directed the unloading of the two-wheeled
pushcart of its contents; two canvas bags of
ancient and scarred footballs, a carboy of water, two
cartons of paper cups, two buckets, a large sponge,
several headguards, a skein of shoe lacings, a battered
black bag and some other objects. The black bag held
Dan’s first-aid appliances. The manager, Jack Macon,
carried a board with a clip at one end that held down
several large sheets of paper. He talked with Mr. Otis
while the two assistant managers, one from the Second
and one from the Third Class, wandered about vaguely
as though anxious to be helpful but not knowing how.
Clif saw the coach pull a watch from his trousers
pocket and glance at it, and nudged his companion.</p>

<p>“Let’s get down,” he said.</p>

<p>So they clumped back to the field, Clif, at least, feeling
extremely unimportant amidst the gathering of
older, larger and self-confident youths. Here and there,
however, was a boy whose appearance or bearing proclaimed
the neophyte, and Clif regained a trifle of assurance.
Tom, although still plainly disapproving of
Mr. Otis, showed no indication of being troubled by
an inferiority complex. He sauntered to the thick of
the throng, and Clif went with him, showing, though,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
a disposition to keep in the lee of his companion’s
slightly larger bulk. The coach clapped his hands and
silence fell, while some sixty canvas-clad youths closed
about him.</p>

<p>“Fellows, we’re starting to-day to lick Wolcott,”
announced “G.G.” “We’ve got eight weeks to do it in.
We’re going to keep our objective in mind every minute
of those eight weeks. There’s going to be a lot of
hard work, and any of you who are afraid of work
had better keep away from me. You won’t like me, and
I’m certain I shan’t like you, and we’d better not try
to mix. I’m dead set on having my own way, and I’m
a crank when I don’t get it. Any one who doesn’t like
the prospect should resign right now. Those of you
who sign up will be expected to stick for the duration.
All right. Shed your headguards, fellows. You won’t
need them to-day. Last season First and Second Team
players and substitutes down the field. The rest of
you here. Mr. Hilliard, will you take this bunch,
please? Balls, Dan!”</p>

<p>Clif and Tom found themselves in the squad under
Mr. Hilliard and put in nearly an hour passing the ball
and receiving it. There were frequent rests, for the
day was hot and most of the squad were soft with easy
living, but the work was hard enough to cause more
than one erstwhile ambitious youth to wonder whether
it wouldn’t be wiser to seek glory in some other less
strenuous pursuit. Even Clif, who had sought to keep
himself conditioned during the summer, was soon perspiring
freely and was both surprised and a trifle dismayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
to find himself puffing. It was evident to him
that his system of summer training had not been a success.
Looking back, he realized that he had spent more
time on the hotel porch or lolling on the sand than he
had meant to!</p>

<p>Mr. Hilliard was called “Pinky” because his hair was
coppery-brown. It didn’t approach red, but since no
other faculty member presented a better claim to the
nickname it was awarded to Mr. Hilliard. He was
about thirty years old, Clif concluded. He was fairly
tall and thin, with a peculiar quick manner of moving
his head; sort of jerky, as Clif phrased it to himself;
like a hen’s!</p>

<p>Practice ended with a single lap around the inner
border of the running track. It nearly finished Clif,
and he ended the circuit at a slow walk. Tom poked
fun at him as they returned to the gymnasium, and
Clif was much too short of breath to make any defense.
So ended the first day.</p>

<p>The second wasn’t much different. There was more
long passing and they practiced starts, but getting
acquainted with the ball was the principal desideratum,
just as yesterday. Both Clif and Tom slightly resented
being treated as members of the kindergarten
class, although acknowledging that it probably wouldn’t
do them any harm. Mr. Otis, who had the first squad
in charge, found time to look over the others occasionally,
and at such times Mr. Hilliard’s pupils sought
pathetically hard to attract the coach’s favorable notice.
Or most of them did. Tom, for some reason not quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
plain to Clif, resented the infrequent visits of “G.G.”
Once, seeing the head coach’s approach, Tom, at the
receiving end of a ten-yard pass, opened his arms wide
as the ball came to him and made a most ridiculously
amateurish effort at catching. The ball went through,
bounded from his body and trickled across the turf.
Tom affected deep chagrin and followed it. He picked
it up a few yards from Mr. Otis and then looked at him
invitingly. The coach returned the look for a moment.
Then he said: “Your left shoe lace is trailing. Fix it.”</p>

<p>Tom sped the ball across vindictively. In a pause
he said to Clif: “Did you hear him? Didn’t I tell you
I wasn’t going to like that guy?”</p>

<p>Clif laughed and then sobered. “What did you want
to do that for, anyway? Just to show off?”</p>

<p>“Why, heck,” answered the other indignantly, “a
fellow can’t catch it every time!”</p>

<p>“Run along and sell your papers!” jeered Clif. “You
did that on purpose. You just wanted Mr. Otis to jump
on you so you could have a grouch on him. Anyway,
I see you’ve tied your lace!”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the dickens,” grumbled Tom.</p>

<p>To-day’s practice lasted longer than yesterday’s and,
since it involved a good deal of running around, it left
the candidates rather more wrung out than on the previous
afternoon. Clif confided to Tom that if he was
called on to jog the track he’d die before he was half-way
around. Fortunately, then, only a handful of
fellows, all from Mr. Otis’s squad, were called on for
that final martyrdom, and Clif was able to reach the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
gymnasium and to insinuate himself under the refreshing
downpour of a shower bath without further suffering.
But he was so fagged out and so lame by the time
supper was over that he flatly refused Tom’s challenge
to chess—a game he knew very little of—and dragged
his weary body up to Number 17 and flopped on his
bed. Tom, not to be deprived of his chess, sought the
recreation room, promising to meet the other for study
hour.</p>

<p>Walter Treat looked mildly disapproving when Clif
stretched his tired body out on the bed. Walter’s
athletic activities were confined to an infrequent game
of tennis and an even more infrequent afternoon of
golf, and it is probable that he didn’t appreciate his
roommate’s condition. Interpreting the look correctly,
though, Clif presented his excuse, wondering as he did
so why he should consider it necessary to secure
Walter’s approval.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why they make you fellows practice on
such a warm day,” observed Walter when Clif had
added a groan to his explanation for good measure.
“Still, I dare say there’s so little time that they can’t
afford to waste any. Better take a hot bath before bed.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that sounds good,” assented Clif. After a
minute he asked: “Say, Walter, do you know who the
fellow in the invalid’s chair is?”</p>

<p>“His name is Deane; either Laurence or Lorin, I
think. His father is Sanford Deane.”</p>

<p>“Sanford Deane? You don’t mean <em>the</em> Sanford
Deane, do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. I’m telling you what I heard. It may not
be right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was,” said Clif.
“He sort of looks like—like somebody important. Was
he here last year?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s new. As for his looking important, maybe
he does, Clif, but I don’t know that the fact that his
father is immensely wealthy gives him the right to!”</p>

<p>“Why, no, and I didn’t mean just that, I guess.
Still, his father is pretty well known, pretty prominent,
aside from being rich, isn’t he? You’re always reading
about him in the papers.”</p>

<p>“Important in a financial way, certainly.” Walter
almost, but not quite, shrugged. “Any one who gets
hold of fifty or sixty million dollars can get his name
in the papers every day if he wants to. Sometimes it
gets there when he doesn’t want it to.”</p>

<p>Walter smiled cynically.</p>

<p class="cap">Clif was glad that the next day was Sunday.</p>

<p>He could lie abed a half-hour later, which
was something to rejoice over, and, save for
church at eleven o’clock, no duties claimed him until
study hour at eight. He awoke before the rising bell
and had a full ten minutes in which to stretch his lame
muscles and accustom himself to the thought of getting
up. The muscles were not as sore as he had expected
they would be, and by the time he was ready for breakfast
he felt quite fit. As though having atoned overnight
for his talkativeness, Walter spoke but twice during
dressing, and then only when spoken to.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Clif and Tom went to walk. They
set out to find the golf links since, although the students
were not allowed to play the game on Sunday, there
were certain club members whose views were less strict
than Doctor Wyndham’s, and Tom had a mind to select
a promising twosome and follow it around, his idea
of spending a Sunday afternoon pleasantly being to
derive entertainment from others at as slight a cost of
physical or mental exertion to himself as possible.
But his plan went agley since a full half-hour’s search
failed to discover the links. Billy Desmond had said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
it was a good mile from the school, and so far he had
proved truthful, but the rest of his information had
been purposely misleading. Perhaps Billy’s idea of
spending a pleasant Sunday afternoon was to sit comfortably
in Number 34, surrounded by pages of the
morning paper, and mentally picture Tom and Clif
seeking a golf course where there never had been one!</p>

<p>They located it finally, however. Having abandoned
search for it, they climbed Baldhead Mountain,
which deserved only the first half of its title and presented
few difficulties, and from the bare granite ledge
on the summit saw figures moving about over a green
expanse some two miles distant. The figures were
recognizable as men playing golf. Tom said “Huh!”
disgustedly and resolutely turned his gaze away.</p>

<p>Well, there were more things than golf courses to be
seen. On a clear day, such as this was, one could look
into three states from the summit of Baldhead. Since,
however, there was no way of telling where Connecticut
merged into Massachusetts or where Massachusetts
became New York one’s satisfaction in the feat
was somewhat dimmed. Tom declared that the different
states should have signs on them.</p>

<p>It was warm up there on the sloping, weather-worn
ledge, but the breeze prevented discomfort. Tom
hugged his knees, sending a puzzled look toward the
distant links. Finally he seemed to see a light, for he
said “<em>By heck!</em>” in a most explosive fashion, following
it, after a moment of grim silence, with: “But I’ll get
even with Billy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Later Clif recalled Walter’s revelations about the
boy in the wheel chair, and he proceeded to spring the
news on Tom. “Say, who do you suppose he is?” he
asked, having introduced the subject.</p>

<p>“King Tut,” said Tom, hurling a pebble into the
distance.</p>

<p>“No, seriously. Well, he’s Sanford Deane’s son!”</p>

<p>“The man who owns all the money in the world?
How come he’s here?” Tom was disappointingly unimpressed,
Clif considered.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he be here? What’s the matter with
this place?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, but there are lots of schools where it costs
you a heap more. You’d think he would send the
fellow to one of those.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see that,” Clif objected. “Anyway,
being a cripple—”</p>

<p>“Did Treat tell you what the trouble with the chap
is?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t ask him.”</p>

<p>“I heard some one say that he hasn’t any legs, but I
don’t believe that. Yesterday that nurse or valet of
his was carrying him upstairs in Middle, and I’m pretty
sure I could see his legs under that rug thing. Of
course they might be artificial.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it either,” said Clif. “He was only
about twenty feet from us in History class yesterday,
and I just know he had plenty of legs!”</p>

<p>“How many?” chuckled Tom. “He isn’t a centipede,
is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“You know what I mean,” Clif laughed. “I’d sort
of like to know him, but he doesn’t give you much encouragement.
Being so blamed rich, maybe he doesn’t
want to have anything to do with us. Still, he doesn’t
<em>look</em> snobbish.”</p>

<p>“I came near speaking to him yesterday,” said Tom,
“but the valet chap looked so sort of snippy I didn’t.
Glad of it now. Guess he’d have frozen me up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry for him, but I don’t want to know
him. Fellows whose folks have a lot of money put on
too many airs for me, old son. Get a move on. I’ve
got to get back and tell Billy where he gets off!”</p>

<p>After a week at school Clif felt as if he had been
there a long while. He had become accustomed to the
routine, and a willing slave to the clanging gong. At
first getting up promptly at seven, slipping inside assembly
hall for prayers before the doors closed at
seven-fifteen and reaching Table 12 for breakfast before
eight had been irksome. And for a day or two he
was forced to consult his schedule frequently in order
to appear at the right recitation room at the proper
time. Accustomed to studying alone, the first study
hour in assembly hall had profited him but little.
You had to go there at eight and sit until nine, surrounded
by something like a hundred and ninety others,
and prepare your next day’s lessons. You could study
as much as you pleased at other times, and in other
places, but between eight and nine in the evening, every
day save Saturday, you had to be present in assembly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
hall. One of the faculty sat on the platform and, lifting
his eyes periodically from his own work, sent his
gaze roving over the big room. Then, perhaps, you’d
hear exchanges like these:</p>

<p>“Asleep, Jones, or thinking?”</p>

<p>There would be a sudden start on the part of Jones,
an agitated clutching of book or paper, and “Thinking,
sir!” Jones would answer.</p>

<p>“Hm. Try doing it without closing the eyes, Jones.”</p>

<p>Or: “I’m sorry, Robinson, that I am too far from
you to listen to that conversation with Brown. It
must be quite interesting.”</p>

<p>“I was just borrowing an eraser, sir.”</p>

<p>“You have it now?”</p>

<p>The eraser would be exhibited as evidence.</p>

<p>“Very well. Hereafter try to provide yourself with
such—er—items before coming here. If it takes you
so long to negotiate the loan of an eraser, Robinson,
I shudder to think what would happen if you found you
had forgotten, say, your fountain pen. The hour
would be all too short, I fear!”</p>

<p>The bright overhead lights, the fluttering of leaves,
the scratching of pens, the shuffling of feet, the presence
of so many others around him all combined to
deprive Clif of whatever power of concentration he
possessed. That first study hour was a total loss so
far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>But he got used to it after a time or two, just as he
got used to other features of life at Wyndham School,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
and his letters to his father were increasingly cheerful.
For days at a time he never went off the school property,
but that was principally because football practice
occupied his afternoons. The mornings were
pretty well taken up with recitations, and with preparing
for them. In the afternoon the last recitation for
Clif was sometimes at half-past two, sometimes at
three. In the latter case he showed up for practice
about ten minutes late. Practice generally ran until
half-past five nowadays, and there was only enough
time for a shower, and a few minutes of rest before
supper time. Between supper and study hour there
was an interim of perhaps an hour and a half, and
after study hour came “prowl.” “Prowl” was the
hour between nine and ten when visiting between
halls was permitted. At ten, unless you were a First
Class fellow, you were required to be back in your
own room; except you were the fortunate possessor
of a permit from a “fac.” At ten-thirty you put your
light out.</p>

<p>Life was busy and interesting. Clif soon discovered
that he was going to have to study rather harder than
last year, but he encountered no real difficulty in any
course. The same was true of Tom save that the latter
was already bogged down, as he phrased it, in English.
That was one study which Tom dreaded and disliked—and
at which he toiled hardest. “That ‘Alick’ guy
thinks I can’t do the fool stuff,” he declared once to
Clif, “but he’s got another think. I’ll do it if it kills
me!” “Alick” was, of course, Mr. Alexander Wyatt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Football claimed a good share of attention, and was
the subject of much conversation between Clif and
Tom, and, frequently, Billy Desmond. Billy was generous
with advice, but although the boys followed the
advice to the best of their abilities, it didn’t, as Clif
put it, seem to get them anything. They worked hard
and conscientiously, just as did three score others, but
without any noticeable improvement in their status.
The candidates had been sorted into four squads by
Wednesday, and Clif and Tom were in Squad D.
Squad D was composed of some sixteen or eighteen
youths of various ages, sizes and football experiences
in charge of “Pinky” Hilliard. “Pinky” also looked
after Squad C, or did so until Friday, when Mr. Babcock
joined the coaching staff. On that afternoon
Squad A, and many of Squad B, were dismissed early,
since the first game was scheduled for the morrow, and
Coach Otis gave his attention to the remaining candidates.
It was the seventh day of practice, and, after
a preliminary hour of passing and falling on the ball,
of starting and tackling the dummy, line and backfield
candidates were separated, and the former hustled to
the north end of the field by the head coach and given
a half hour’s instruction in their duties.</p>

<p>Afterwards, punters and forwards were sent to one
side of the field, and backs to the other, and the balls
were soon arching across to be pulled down by the
backfield candidates, and run back while tackles and
ends came across to meet them. Hard tackling was
barred, however, the man with the ball either being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
run off to one side or merely blocked with the body.
Clif, encountering Tom several times in midfield, regretted
the prohibition. It would have added greatly
to his enjoyment of the occasion to have been allowed
to topple the dodging, feinting Tom to earth. He did
secure some satisfaction on one encounter, however,
by knocking the ball from Tom’s grasp and jeering as
the latter vented outraged feelings and trotted off in
pursuit. The air was full of flying balls, players raced
this way and that and shouts of “Mine!” or “I’ve got
it!” vied with the calls of the coaches. Lacking a
scrimmage to watch, the audience in the stand was
grateful for so much action, and, lolling comfortably
in the shade, lazily voiced approval of a good punt
or a clever catch or chortled merrily over some amusing
incident.</p>

<p>At the farther edge of the running track, toward the
school buildings, two onlookers sat quite by themselves.
One, covered to his waist by a light rug, leaned
back at ease in a wheel chair. The second occupied a
folding canvas stool set at the left and slightly to the
rear of his companion. He was rather tall and rather
bony, and, seated bolt upright, the inner edges of his
shining black shoes touching, a hand on either knee
of his carefully creased black serge trousers, he looked
painfully respectable and extremely uncomfortable.
The idea must have occurred to the occupant of the
chair for he asked, glancing around:</p>

<p>“Comfortable, Wattles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite, sir. Absolutely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>Loring Deane smiled. No one, he was aware, not
even the capable Wattles, could be really comfortable
for any length of time on one of those silly, backless
canvas stools; especially while sitting bolt upright. He
had tried to induce Wattles to bring a chair along, offering
to carry it in front of him, but Wattles had been
frightfully outraged at the bare suggestion. Loring
returned to watching the scene, and Wattles, producing
an immaculate handkerchief from the breast pocket
of his black coat, removed the black derby from his
head and gently mopped a perspiring forehead. Then,
handkerchief and hat properly returned to their respective
places, hands again on the seams of his trousers,
he, too, gave his attention once more to the somewhat
astonishing proceedings.</p>

<p>Football of this particular style was new to Wattles.
Wattles had been born in England some thirty years
ago, and, although he had been in this country ever
since the age of nineteen and once a year strode, almost
impressively, to the polling booth and cast his vote,
he was still English. His speech scarcely betrayed him
since he had gone to much pains to acquire the phraseology
and accent of his adopted country, but one had
only to view his countenance to surprise his secret.
Loring’s father had once declared that Wattles had
the features of a faithful horse. That was perhaps a
picturesque exaggeration, but it couldn’t be denied
that there was something oddly equine in Wattles’s face.
He had pale brown eyes, a remarkably long and very
sizable nose and a chin—well, the best description of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Wattles’s lower features is that, below the straight,
slightly loose mouth, they just sort of faded right
out of the picture!</p>

<p>“You might at least have worn your straw hat,”
said the boy severely a few minutes later. “That derby
must be beastly hot.”</p>

<p>“I don’t find it so, Mister Loring,” replied Wattles
earnestly. “A straw always seems much warmer on
the head than a bowl—I should say derby, sir.”</p>

<p>“Just your silly British obstinacy,” chuckled Loring.
“They only discovered straw hats over there a few
years ago; after you left, I guess; and I suppose your
folks for thousands of years back wore bowler hats
on every occasion, summer and winter, and you’d rather
be shot than be seen in anything else. To my knowledge
you’ve worn that straw I made you buy just once,
and then you looked so miserable I was really sorry
for you.”</p>

<p>Wattles smiled respectfully. “Without doubt, sir,
there’s a great deal in heredity.”</p>

<p>“And there’s a great deal in red-headity, too,
Wattles,” laughed Loring. “Red-headity means stubbornness.”</p>

<p>“Really, sir? I never heard the word. That is,
begging your pardon, Mister Loring, I never happened—”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t,” agreed the boy. “I just invented
it. I guess those fellows are frightfully hot, Wattles.
There are some compensations for my enforced inactivity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
after all. Chasing around on a day like this
would be a mite uncomfortable, eh?”</p>

<p>“Quite, sir. Perfectly grilling, sir. But are the
young gentlemen obliged to exercise so violently?”</p>

<p>“Depends on one’s understanding of the word,
Wattles. Of course they don’t actually <em>have</em> to play,
but they want to, and when you try for the team you’ve
got to do what you are told to. The man over there
in the white shirt is the coach, and his business is to
teach those chaps how to play good football, and he
has less than two months to do it. I dare say he has
a bunch of last year fellows to build around, but there’s
next year to think of, too, and so he has not only to
develop enough players to fill up this season’s team, but
must supply himself with material to draw on next
fall. That means that he has to hustle from the very
start, Wattles, and explains why he has those chaps
there puffing so hard.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’d no idea the game was quite so—so
intensive.”</p>

<p>The boy chuckled. “Wattles, your vocabulary is getting
richer every day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Was it the wrong word, sir?” asked the man anxiously.
“I understand—”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Quite proper, in fact. I dare say the
English game’s a bit less vehement, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say that, Mister Loring. It’s played very
hard, but I fancy the preparation is not quite so—so
severe. I’ve seen only a few games since I left the
other side, sir, and I may be wrong. I gather that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the sort of football played here is quite different from
the English game.”</p>

<p>“You’ve never seen our style of football, have you?
Why, yes, I think you’ll notice a difference. I
dare say they’ll be putting on a scrimmage in a day
or two, and you’ll have a chance to compare the two
games.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it will be most interesting, sir.”</p>

<p>An escaped football trickled across the running track
and came to a stop a few feet from the chair. Wattles,
an adventurous gleam in his eyes, started to rise, but
a boy in togs was in pursuit, and, crunching across
the cinders, scooped up the ball. Wattles relapsed, disappointedly,
to his former composure. With the ball
in one hand, the player glanced smilingly at the boy
in the wheel chair.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said. “Pretty warm, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Very,” answered Loring. There wasn’t time for
more, for the rather tall youth with the nice eyes, and
the pleasant, friendly smile, turned quickly, dropped the
ball, met it with the instep of his right foot and jogged
back toward the middle of the playing field. Loring
watched the scuffed, brown leather ball arch away on
a forty-yard flight, and settle into the arms of a waiting
player.</p>

<p>“That’s a fellow who spoke to me one night in the
corridor, Wattles. Gave me a hand getting into that
meeting room. Rather a nice, clean looking chap, isn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Very, sir. Quite the gentleman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.” Loring was silent a moment. Then, following
a long sigh, he said: “Wattles, I’d give anything
in the world if I could do that!”</p>

<p>“Do—I beg your pardon, Mister Loring?”</p>

<p>“What he did, I mean. Just kick a football!”</p>

<small>MR. BABCOCK TAKES HOLD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Saturday noon Clif stood on the steps of
West Hall and filled his lungs with air. Room
G, in Middle, had been more than usually stuffy,
and a stiff session with “The Turk” had left the boy
feeling rather limp. Generally algebra went fairly
smoothly for Clif, but to-day he had floundered badly.
It had seemed that Mr. Way, possessed of uncanny
power, had surmised Clif’s condition and had malignantly,
relentlessly exposed it. Yet, although there had
been some bad moments, and “The Turk” had displayed
his ability for sarcasm, Clif had got through not too
disastrously. Retiring from the blackboard, dusting
chalk from his fingers, perspiring gently, he had found
the boy in the wheel chair regarding him sympathetically
from across the room. There had been, too, a
twinkle in the chap’s eyes that had seemed to say,
“Good work! He didn’t floor you, anyhow!”</p>

<p>Easing the two books he carried to his other arm,
Clif gave a final look at the sunlit lawn that stretched
away to the distant tree-bordered street, took a last
breath of the warm, fresh air, and turned to reënter
the building. But at that moment a big, shining car,
standing further along the drive, beyond East Hall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
entrance, came to life and rolled noiselessly forward,
and came to a stop at the steps. At about the same
instant a group of four persons emerged from the further
entrance: a slim, beautifully dressed woman, a
black-clothed man in a square-crowned derby hat carrying
without evident exertion the boy who, but a few
minutes before, had flashed congratulations to Clif
across the recitation room, and, lastly, a small Junior
School youth. The woman—even at the distance Clif
could see that she was remarkably pretty—entered the
car, the man in black deposited his burden beside her,
the small Junior ensconced himself rather diffidently
in the corner, and the derby hat placed itself beside
the plum-colored cap of the chauffeur. Then the car
moved forward again, gathered speed, and purred softly
past West and down the shaded driveway, the poised
figure above the radiator glinting in the sunlight. As
the car passed the single occupant of the West Hall steps,
Loring Deane leaned across the younger boy beside
him and waved. Clif waved back, but too late to be
seen.</p>

<p>He watched the car out of sight, approving the speckless
luster of its long, sleek body, its smooth, almost
soundless progress. Even the blue and white number
plate at the rear shone immaculately, seeming to proclaim
not only that the owner was a resident of New
York, but that he was the possessor of great wealth,
since, or so Clif had long since concluded, only those
of great wealth were able to drive about in cars as immaculate
as this one! The lady was, he supposed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Deane’s mother. Since Saturday was a half-holiday
she was probably taking him home for a visit. He
found himself envying the small Junior who, tucked
into the corner, hadn’t looked as though he was half
appreciating his luck.</p>

<p>But Clif’s guess proved wrong later. When the
game with Freeburg High School began at three o’clock
the big dark blue car was standing at the farther side
of the gridiron, beyond the running track. The Junior
was no longer in it. Mrs. Deane and Loring were the
sole occupants, Loring’s attendant and the chauffeur
being seated together on the grass a short distance
away. Clif drew Tom’s attention to the car and Tom
said: “Gosh! It’s one of those English whatyoucallems,
isn’t it? Say, that’s some cart, if you want to
know! You say that’s Mrs. Deane? What’s she like?”</p>

<p>“Awfully pretty,” said Clif emphatically. “I wasn’t
very close to them, but she looked corking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if you have plenty of money you can look
like—like Venus herself, I guess,” answered Tom pessimistically.
“Maybe close to she wouldn’t look so
wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she would,” said Clif stoutly. “I’ll bet you
anything—”</p>

<p>But as Freeburg kicked off just then the conversation
ended abruptly.</p>

<p>Clif and Tom watched the game from the ground
beside the track. There was no room for them on the
benches, nor for a dozen more equally unimportant
members of the squad, and so they spread their blue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
blankets on the grass and sat cross-legged while the
battle raged. As a football contest that first game of
the Wyndham schedule didn’t amount to very much,
but since it gave the School its first opportunity to see
their heroes in action, it secured a full attendance.
Freeburg presented a light team which tried to make
speed atone for weight, and didn’t quite succeed, as
the final score attested. Both coaches used the occasion
to try out a long list of substitutes and the game
was considerably slowed up because of the constant
changes. Wyndham’s line contained four veterans,
and her backfield two when the game began. Captain
Lothrop, playing his third season at Wyndham, was at
left guard, Archer at left end, Higgs at center, Stoddard
at quarter, Jensen at right half and Fargo at
full back. These men constituted the nucleus on which
the coaches hoped to build a winning team, and there
appeared to be no reason why they shouldn’t succeed.
Beside the real veterans there were at least another half-dozen
candidates who had served last year either as
First Team substitutes or Second Team players. And
there were, of course, a considerable number of less
experienced youths from the class teams, or, like Clif
and Tom, from outside. Coach Otis did not appear
to lack material, even though the first grand total of
something over sixty had now been reduced to about
fifty. Before the Freeburg game was at an end—ten-minute
periods were played—“G.G.” had watched no
fewer than thirty-one candidates perform. Sad to relate,
however, neither Clif nor Tom were among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
number. They were allowed to sit undisturbed throughout
the contest.</p>

<p>The playing was fairly ragged on both sides, and the
game lacked interest. The day was much too warm for
football, and the home team and the visitors alike suffered.
The Dark Blue held to a tackle-to-tackle offense,
and only twice offered anything in the way of
aerial attack. Then two short passes over the end of
the line were tried with negative results. Most of
Wyndham’s gains were made between the opposing
guards and tackles. Once or twice the Freeburg center
was battered down, but the youth who occupied the
pivotal position for the visitors was extremely capable
and turned back most of the plays directed against him.
The Dark Blue put over one touchdown in the first
period, and hung up seven points. In the next quarter
a second touchdown was added, but Stoddard missed
the try-at-goal. Freeburg forced the fighting after
half-time, and produced the only thrilling incident of
the performance when her quarter got loose with the
ball near his own forty-yard line, and ran to Wyndham’s
seven. There he was pulled down by Ogden,
playing right half for Jensen, and the exultant shouts
of the Freeburg rooters were cut short. But they
broke forth again some two minutes later when, following
two unsuccessful tries at the Dark Blue line,
a fleet-footed substitute was shot into the visitor’s
line-up, and took the pigskin on a wide run around
his left end, placing it a scant twelve inches from the
goal line. With one down remaining, Freeburg concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
on Quinlan, at left guard, and smashed
through for a score. A minute afterwards she turned
the 6 into a 7. Just before that third period ended
the Dark Blue hammered her way across the enemy
goal-line for a third touchdown from which, again,
no goal resulted. The final quarter witnessed the introduction
of practically two fresh teams but produced
no scoring. Wyndham chalked up a 19 to 7 victory
to start the season’s schedule.</p>

<p>Talking the game over that evening, Clif and Tom
arrived almost simultaneously at the same conclusion,
which, as Tom put it, was this: “You and I, old son,
have about as much chance to make the team this year
as I have to win the Condon Prize for English! Why,
heck, no one knows we’re on the squad! That coach
doesn’t even see us.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, I guess,” Clif agreed sadly. “That
bunch is too big and too heavy for us to associate with.
What we’d better do is quit and put in our time beefing
up.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t only that, because some of the fellows who
played to-day—or tried to—weren’t so blamed big, but
that Otis dumb-bell can’t see any fellow outside the
little bunch he’s nursed from last year. The trouble
with us is we’re outsiders, Clif. What we need is
advertising, I guess. Say, that’s an idea! Let’s put
an ad in next week’s <cite>Lantern</cite>. Something like this:
‘Mr. Clifton Bingham and Mr. Thomas Kemble present
their compliments to the Football Committee, and
Coaches, and solicit their patronage.’ Hold on, though.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
This is better: ‘Experienced end and clever half-back
want positions on Football Team. Interview arranged.
Address “Neglected,” care <cite>Lantern</cite>.’ How’s that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the Committee ever reads the <cite>Lantern</cite>,”
said Clif.</p>

<p>“They ought to, for it’s a very truthful publication.
Like last week when it said that sixty-something candidates
were ‘frying for the Team.’ Maybe it meant to
say ‘trying,’ but, considering the weather, it was dead
right. Well, the best we can expect, Clif, is to make
the Second; and we may get left there!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how. They’ve got to have somebody
for it, and if Mr. Otis makes another cut Monday, as
they say he’s going to, there won’t be many left.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Maybe we’ll be among the—the cutees!
Oh, well, never say die. Let’s go down and see what
they’re getting on the radio.”</p>

<p>There was a brand-new notice on the board outside
the locker room door on Monday when Clif reached
the gymnasium, and his heart missed a beat as he
stopped to read it. He was alone, since Tom had a
late recitation, and he was glad of it just then. “Attention
Football Candidates,” he read. “The following
players will report to Coach Babcock on Second Team
field at 3:30 Monday: Adams, Ames, Bingham—”</p>

<p>Clif drew a long breath. His feelings oddly combined
disappointment and relief. For the first moment
disappointment was uppermost, but then the realization
that he had long since discounted being dropped
from the First Team, and that as lately as Saturday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
evening he had been doubtful of making the Second,
produced a reaction. He guessed he was pretty lucky,
after all. There were only some twenty names on this
list, which meant that fully a dozen fellows had been
dropped completely. Then his eyes hurried down the
first column and across to the second. “Howlett,
Jackson, Kemble—”</p>

<p>Good! Tom had made it, too! Then, as he went
on into the locker room, it occurred to him that perhaps
Tom wouldn’t be as gratified as he was. Perhaps Tom,
in spite of his pessimistic utterances, had secretly expected
to be retained on the First! But later in the
afternoon Tom scouted the idea with convincing sincerity.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t the ghost of a chance, Clif, and I knew it the
second day of practice. I can play football pretty
well, but I haven’t had the experience fellows like
Dave Lothrop and Billy Desmond and Pete Jensen
and a lot more have had. And, of course, I’m light.
No, sir, I’m satisfied to be here, old son. Besides,
I’m going to get a lot of fun out of showing some of
those First Team swelled-heads that they don’t know
all the football there is, as good as they may be! Heck,
I’m not kicking!”</p>

<p>And neither was Clif. In fact, after listening to Mr.
Babcock’s talk to them on the old wooden baseball
grand stand that had been moved aside to make room
for the gridiron, he had begun to wonder whether
being a member of so glorious a company as the Scrub
wasn’t a far better thing than belonging to the First<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Team! Of course common sense told him later that
it wasn’t, but Mr. Babcock had almost made it seem
so for the moment!</p>

<p>“Cocky” seemed to have left behind him in the gymnasium
some of the brusqueness that awed his classes.
To-day he acted and looked and spoke like a “regular
fellow.” He had on a pair of old canvas football
pants, a faded red sweater and two of the most disreputable
gray woolen stockings ever seen out of a
rag bag. Those stockings had been frequently and
variously darned until there remained but very little
of the original material; and despite all the mending
they still cried out for help. “Cocky’s” sturdy calves
were visible in wide areas in more places than one!
“Cocky” wasn’t a handsome man, for his face was too
square, his nose too blunt and his eyebrows too heavy.
To be frank, Mr. Henry Babcock, B.A., looked rather
like a retired gentleman pugilist; or, perhaps, like one’s
idea of such a person. He was about thirty years old,
affected very loose tweed suits and, between the hours
of five and six, behind the closed door of Number 19
East Hall, played weird melodies on an English horn.
Any one who has ever heard an English horn engaged
in rendering a solo will understand why the door was
closed!</p>

<p>“I’ve got a little speech to make, fellows,” said
“Cocky,” spreading a pair of muscular arms along
the edge of the seat behind him, “so you’d better sit
down, and make yourselves comfortable for a few
minutes. Now, then, you know what a Scrub Team<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
is for, but perhaps you don’t realize just how important
it is. This School sets out every year at about this
time to beat Wolcott. That’s what we all want to do;
you and I, and Doctor Wyndham and Coach Otis and
every fellow, big or little, who owes allegiance to
Wyndham. To beat Wolcott we must have a whopping
good team, a better team this year than last,
maybe. We have a pretty stiff schedule arranged;
eight games; three of them away from home; planned
to bring us along slowly and surely to the final contest.
When that comes along our team must be in top form,
trained to the minute. That may sound easy, but it’s
really pretty hard. It means lots of work, work that
gets a little harder day by day; it means attention to
diet, strict watch on the physical condition of every
man, for it’s quite as easy to overtrain as to train too
little; and it means putting into practice every day
what you have learned the day before. That’s where
we come in, fellows.</p>

<p>“Our business is to beat Wolcott, just as it is the
First Team’s business. We do it—if we succeed—by
helping the First to learn how. There’s glory in that,
fellows, lots of glory. I want you to realize it. I
want you to start in with the conviction that you are
doing your share to secure a Wyndham victory over
Wolcott. I want you to be just as proud of being a
Second Team player as you’d be of belonging to the
First. When the big day comes the cheers won’t be
for you, maybe, but you’ll know in your hearts that
you deserve a share of them, and you’ll be satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
with what you’ve done, and proud of your team, the
team that showed the big team how to win!</p>

<p>“I’ve handled this team for four years, fellows, and
I’ve always enjoyed it, always taken pride in it, always
felt a mighty lot of satisfaction, when the season was
done, over my part in the victory or the defeat that
came to us. Because you mustn’t think, any of you,
that there isn’t honor in defeat. The team that plays
cleanly, gallantly, fights its hardest when Luck turns
its back, is downed and won’t stay downed, wins honor
indeed. Well, now, here we are. Twenty of us. ‘Mr.
Babcock’s Team,’ the ‘Second’ or the ‘Scrub.’ Call
yourself what you like. It doesn’t make much difference
what we’re called or what we call ourselves, so
long as we do what’s expected of us with all our might.
So let’s get together, fellows, and show Wyndham
the finest, fightingest Second Team it has ever seen!
Remember this, too. You’re not only helping to win
the Wolcott game this year, you’re training yourself
for next year. You Second Team fellows will be First
Team fellows next fall. Most of you, anyhow. It
isn’t unlikely that one or two of you will get to the
big team this season. Just show Mr. Otis that you’ve
got something the First Team needs, and you won’t
stay here long!</p>

<p>“Just so that it won’t be all work and no play, I’ve
arranged three outside games for you. We’ll play
Freeburg High School a week from next Saturday,
Minster High School on November third, and the
Wolcott Second Team on November tenth. We could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
have more games if we were permitted to play away
from home. But we aren’t, and I think three will be
enough, anyhow. So now you know what’s ahead
of you, Scrub. A lot of steady, grinding work, a little
play, and virtue more or less its own reward. Who’s
for it?”</p>

<p>It was evident that all were. A shout went up from
twenty throats that carried as far as the diamond and
aroused interest and conjecture there. Having joined
his voice with the others, Clif turned and looked rather
pityingly toward the First Team field. Those poor
chaps over there didn’t realize what they were missing!
Mr. Babcock was speaking again. He was on his feet
now, and in response to the suggestion of his movement
the fellows were leaving the seats.</p>

<p>“We’ll have the first scrimmage with the other gang
about Friday. That gives us four days to get ready.
I’d suggest that before the Freeburg game you elect
a captain. But don’t do it just yet. Wait until you’ve
played together awhile. Until you choose a leader
for yourself you’ll need some one in authority, though,
and so I’ll appoint Henning temporary captain.”</p>

<p>“Cheer for Captain Clem!” laughed some one.</p>

<p>Clement Henning grinned sheepishly. He was a big
First Class fellow who had played guard for two years
on scrub teams. He was steady, hard working, good-natured
and slow. Last season, for a brief and glorious
fortnight, he had been transferred to the big team,
but he couldn’t hold down his job there, and had returned,
untroubled, it appeared, to the Scrub. Clem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
could play football to a certain point, but he never
could get beyond that point. It is probable that all
the coaches in the country, working together on him
in relays, would have failed to make Clem play any
better than he had played last year or would play this.
But if he lacked football genius he was long on popularity.
Every one knew Clem Henning and every one
liked him.</p>

<p>The cheer wasn’t given, but the selection met with
sounds of approval from all. “Cocky” went on,
briskly now:</p>

<p>“We’re going to start right at the very bottom, fellows.
No one who can’t make a good tackle or handle
the ball properly is good enough for this outfit. We’ll
have some passing now to warm up, and as soon as
the First is through with the dummy we’ll go down
there, and eat some dirt. We’ll divide the squad, Captain
Henning, and you’ll take half and I’ll take half.
All right, let’s have those balls, Hoppin. Over here,
a bunch of you. Now then, Scrub, let’s get going!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>MR. BINGHAM PAYS A VISIT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That first feeling of exaltation didn’t last
long, but it had served its purpose. The
Wyndham Scrub members had shared it together
and, since the experience of a common emotion
creates a bond, had become imbued with a solidarity
that was to prove the foundation of greater unity and
cohesion. Which was all that Mr. Babcock had expected.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the Scrub had its first line-up and ran
through a few formations. Adams was at left end,
Ames at left tackle, Greene at left guard, Ridgway at
center, Henning at right guard, Coles at right tackle,
Bingham at right end, Jackson at quarter, Kemble at
left half, Stiles at right half and Thayer at fullback.
But as “Cocky” explicitly stated that no one could be
sure of his position until he had definitely earned it,
and as none save Henning and “Wink” Coles kept
his place throughout the whole half-hour, neither Clif
nor Tom indulged in self-congratulation. Clif had
Patch and Gosman to fight for the right end position,
and Tom was always aware that Gillespie and Heard
were following close behind, awaiting their turns.
Mr. Babcock made them work hard, but they had plenty
of enthusiasm and liked working. Now and then a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
word, or perhaps a brief halt while the coach stared
silently toward the First Team players, kept the incentive
in mind. They were there to mold themselves
into a first-class fighting unit so that they might meet
the friendly enemy on fairly even terms, and so serve
as the whetstone against which the latter was to be
shaped and edged into a conquering weapon. But—and
they dwelt relishingly on this—if the whetstone
sometimes proved too hard for the steel, why, so much
the better for every one! In other words, duty demanded
that they prove themselves a worthy foe, and
inclination kept a full jump ahead of duty! There
were no personal grudges being nursed: no player on
the Scrub had a bone to pick with any member of the
other team; but there was, nevertheless, the conviction,
shared by all, that the wisdom of the Head Coach’s
selections had yet to be proved, and it was up to them
to show that proof didn’t exist! In such a spirit,
then, the Wyndham Scrub Team—or “Mr. Babcock’s
Team,” as the <cite>Lantern</cite> called it—started forth.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the Scrub and the First took
place in a drizzle of rain and, partly for that reason,
but more especially because Mr. Otis’s charges had a
game the next day, the encounter was slow and tame.
There were two scrimmages of some ten minutes each,
the first with the first-string line-up, and the second
with the substitutes. Play was continually stopped by
the Head Coach for criticism and instruction, the ball
was brought back half a dozen times because something
had not gone just right, and, finally, when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
pigskin had been slapped down on the soggy ground
close to the Scrub’s fifteen-yard line by Captain Lothrop
after a savage romp through the enemy’s left wing,
“G.G.” ordered a dropkick, and Houston, playing
quarter, mishandled the wet ball so that it banged into
the crowd, and was chased to the side-line and downed
by Clif. It was only in the second period, however,
when faced by the First Team substitutes that the
Scrub could show any offense. Then, with fewer interruptions,
the Second’s backs got to working and
made the most of the opponents’ right side, slamming
through a dozen times before they were finally stopped.
But the First Team’s twelve yards was the nearest the
Scrubs could approach to the goal, and from there,
when two tries had been smeared, Sim Jackson booted
for a miss. A few minutes later a First Team substitute,
and a third-string man at that, scooped up a
trickling ball and galloped for some forty yards to
the Scrub’s goal-line, making the only score of the
day, and registering the Scrub’s first defeat. On the
whole, Mr. Babcock’s warriors didn’t cover themselves
with glory during their première. The coach, patiently
and cheerfully explaining their shortcomings afterwards,
was, it seemed, far less depressed than the
players.</p>

<p>“What was wrong to-day can be corrected to-morrow,”
he ended. “I’m not expecting you fellows to
play perfect football yet. I’m satisfied if you realize
your mistakes when you make them, and I think you
do. You won’t make me mad until you make the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
mistakes the second time—or the third. When a player
knows he’s wrong there’s hope for him: when he can’t
see it, he’s useless. Some of you fellows showed real
stuff to-day. You, Jackson, for one. You mixed only
one signal, and you kept your team on the jump. And
Ridgway held the center nicely. And two or three
others of you deserve a good word; Bingham, for instance.
There was no one within two yards of him
when he got that ball after the blocked kick. Remember,
fellows, that every loose ball has ‘Touchdown’
written on it in big red letters! Patch, you’d better
let Farrell see that hand. Looks rather like a dislocation
from the swelling. We’ll try to get started at
two to-morrow, fellows, so that we can see some of
the game. I want every one of you to watch the
First Team players carefully every chance you get.
Keep your eye on the men you’ll play against and see
where they’re weak. And try to guess the plays before
they start. Watch the backs and see what you can
learn from the way they stand. Some players will give
away the play time and again if you know the language
of signs!”</p>

<p>Clif wasn’t nearly as excited over his father’s visit
on the morrow as he had expected to be. Of course
he was awfully glad he was coming, and he wanted to
see him a whole lot and there were loads of things he
had saved up to tell him, but he went to sleep that
Friday night as soon as his head touched the pillow
and awoke the next morning to only the mildest thrill.
Mr. Bingham rolled up the drive in the blue car about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
one o’clock, and Clif, who had hurried through his
dinner, was awaiting him at the steps. Mr. Bingham
said “Hello, son,” very casually, and Clif grinned,
and said “Hello, dad” in much the same tone. But
they shook hands very hard and, after the car had
been parked at the end of the drive, they made their
way to Number 17 with the older man’s arm about
the boy’s shoulder. Clif was a little bit conscious of
that arm as they passed the recreation room and Office,
but he carried off the situation gracefully. If any of
the fellows they met felt any inclination toward ridicule
Clif’s sharp eyes failed to detect the fact. Generally
what he read on their passing countenances was
admiration for that well-built, handsome, smiling father
of his, and Clif forgot his momentary embarrassment
and was proud and pleased.</p>

<p>Oddly enough—or so it seemed to Clif—his father
and Walter Treat took to each other instantly, and
Clif was a trifle annoyed to discover that Walter’s
acceptance of his father seemed more important to
him than his father’s approval of Walter! Just as
though, he reflected later as he hurried away to the
field, it mattered a bit what Walter thought! But he
was glad that his roommate had offered to look after
the visitor during practice. They didn’t meet again
until the Scrub Team, released after an hour’s strenuous
work, invaded the grand stand to witness the last half
of the contest with Highland School. Walter had
somehow managed to occupy the better part of two
seats and Clif squeezed himself down beside his father.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
The Dark Blue had scored a field-goal in the second
period, but had not been able to cross the enemy’s goal-line.
Highland, playing a far better defensive than
offensive game, had failed to score. In the third
quarter Fargo and Jenkins between them took the ball
to the enemy’s eleven yards from where a forward-pass
grounded, and from where, on fourth down, Fargo’s
end run was stopped on the eight yards. It was not
until late in the last period that Wyndham got her
second score. Then, after a long run by Whitemill
had brought the battle to Highland’s thirty-yard line,
Fargo dashed past tackle for eight, threw across center
to Archer for nine more, and then took the ball on the
thirteen yards and, with the other backs faking a tandem
on the right of center, tore through on the left,
shook off three tackles and crossed the goal-line standing
up!</p>

<p>Stoddard was hurried in the try-for-point, but the
ball shot off to the right, and Wyndham had to be
satisfied with nine points as her share of the afternoon’s
diversion. Highland had nothing left to offer in the
way of attack, and the rest of the final period passed
with the ball see-sawing back and forth about the
center of the field, Coach Otis sending in substitutes
lavishly, and the stand gradually emptying.</p>

<p>There was just time to ride into the village with dad
and see him safely settled at the Inn before six o’clock.
Then Clif hurried back to supper, secured permission
to spend the evening outside, and, feeling a wee bit
important, strode down the drive at seven, dressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
in his best. Mr. Bingham had discovered a billiard
table at the Inn, and was knocking the balls around
when Clif found him. “Get your cue, son,” he said.
“You’ll find one there with a tip if you look hard.
I haven’t whaled you for a long time!”</p>

<p>Clif, who didn’t care much for billiards, consented
to humor the other, but he had no idea of spending the
evening in such unexciting fashion, and when eight
o’clock arrived he hauled an unenthusiastic parent across
the street to Freeburg’s one palace of amusement, the
Coliseum. The Coliseum was about the size of the
library back home in Providence, but it was clean and
it offered good, if not recent, pictures. Mr. Bingham
professed to be greatly awed by the red, white and
blue splendor of the exterior and embarrassed Clif
somewhat by insisting on viewing the gaudy and startling
pictures in the small lobby painstakingly before
purchasing tickets from the interested young lady who
chewed her gum so rhythmically inside the glass cage.
Aware of the curious stares of theater-going Freeburg,
Clif tugged at his father’s arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, dad!” he begged.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bingham was not to be hurried. “I want
to be sure,” he declared sedately, “that everything is
quite proper, Clif. You know there’s a good deal
being said these days about the influence of moving
pictures on the young, and I’d very much dislike to
have you tell me in later years that you traced your
downfall to the night I took you to see—now what
the dickens—ah, here it is—to see ‘Outlawed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Honor’! To me, Clif, this man, Johnny Rick, looks
rather a desperate character. Isn’t he killing the gentleman
with the drooping, black mustache in that picture?”</p>

<p>“Aw, dad!” whispered Clif.</p>

<p>“All right, but I’ll ask for seats well away from the
stage, son. Pistol shooting always makes me jump.”</p>

<p>In spite of the fun Mr. Bingham poked at the entertainment
provided by the Coliseum that evening, it
would have been apparent to any one that he got more
pleasure from it than the more blasé Clif. He became
visibly excited when, in the fourth reel, the redoubtable
hero, the aforementioned Mr. Rick, dashed into
the deserted cabin, seized the heroine in his elastic-banded
arms, with not even a glance at the sizzling
fuse that led to the enormous can of dynamite, dashed
out again and spurred his faithful horse to safety.
Of course Clif knew perfectly well that the cabin
wouldn’t blow up until the hero was well out of the
way, but apparently the idea hadn’t occurred to his
father, for the latter relapsed, exhausted by emotion,
against Clif’s shoulder. Fathers are sometimes very
trying.</p>

<p>On Sunday there was a banquet for four at the Inn.
Clif had all along intended to invite Tom to dinner
on this occasion, but the inclusion of Walter in the
party had been Mr. Bingham’s idea. Not that Clif
really minded. It merely hadn’t and wouldn’t have
occurred to him. Walter was rather an addition, as
it turned out, for “the beggar could talk about anything,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
as Tom put it, and Tom didn’t care a great
deal who talked so long as he was able to devote himself
undisturbedly to the chief matter in hand, which
on this occasion was putting away a very considerable
amount of broiled chicken and appropriate trimmings.
Walter and Mr. Bingham became involved in an earnest,
though friendly, argument over the coffee, as to
the relative values of classical and practical educations,
a discussion that rather bored the others. After the
question had been settled to the satisfaction of both
contenders, following the yielding of much ground by
each, the car was brought forth from a nearby garage,
and, with Clif at the wheel and Tom beside him, they
set forth to see as much of the world as was practicable
in the two hours left at Mr. Bingham’s disposal.</p>

<p>They got back to West Hall at a quarter past four
and Mr. Bingham said good-by and swung the car
toward Providence. Saying good-by this time hadn’t
been hard at all, Clif thought as he followed Walter
and Tom into the Hall. He felt a little guilty about it.</p>

<p>On Monday the Scrub had an easy session when it
went over to the enemy’s lair, for many of the latter,
all those who had taken any considerable part in the
Highland game, had been excused. The Scrub showed
up better, under these circumstances, and scored twice
to the First Team’s once. Although the honor of making
the first score of the season fell to Sim Jackson
when he booted an easy field-goal, to Thomas Ackerman
Kemble was credited the first crossing of the
enemy’s goal-line. That historic event occurred in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
last period when, held for three downs by a horde
of substitutes writhing under “G.G.’s” caustic comments,
Sim slipped the pigskin to Tom on a delayed
pass, and Tom flashed around the right and wormed
through in some remarkable way, reaching the goal-line
without much opposition until a frantic back
tackled and accompanied him across the last two yards.
Being unable to shake off the enemy, Tom just took
him along.</p>

<p>Although the Scrub’s victory had been secured from
a much weakened First, it held some glory, and the
Scrub made the most of it. It gave them confidence,
and the next afternoon, when the first-string men were
back on the job, Mr. Babcock’s disciples showed quite
a nice brand of football. Of course the First had its
way in the end, but it had to fight for it, and fight
hard. Ike Patch started at left end for the Scrub,
but Clif displaced him after five minutes, and was
allowed to play through. Ever since Clif had chased
down that loose ball on Friday “Cocky” had seemed
to hold him in deep respect, and Tom, not at all certain
of his own position, declared that Clif had
“vamped” the coach, and was settled for the season.
Clif began to believe it himself by Wednesday.</p>

<p>On that afternoon the audience, looking on from a
windswept stand and shivering under sweaters, saw
a very pretty practice game. The Scrubs romped in
from the suburbs armed with three brand-new plays
meticulously designed by Mr. Babcock to take advantage
of the enemy’s weaknesses. The principal weakness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
just then was the lack of a good defense against
forward-passes, and although the Scrub had yet to
show any startling proficiency in passing, “Cocky” had
provided two plays that might benefit his team. These
plays, together with a third that didn’t rely on tossing
the ball into the teeth of an October gale for success,
had been hastily and not too thoroughly taught that
afternoon, and Sim Jackson’s brain was still roiled by
his attempt to add this fresh matter to all the other
stored there. The Scrub Team to-day was on its toes
from the start. Somehow it had become inbued with
the notion that it was <em>good</em>! And when a team gets
that idea in its head, and is willing to work like the
dickens to prove that it is correct, why, that team is
hard to stop.</p>

<p>To-day was no sort of day to slow up play for instruction,
and so Mr. Otis swallowed many remarks
that almost choked him and let the battle surge. And it
surely surged. The very appearance of the Scrub
players had been an affront, with their cocksure swaggering
as they took the field, and now, with the war on,
their behavior was preposterously insulting. The poor
weaklings, culls from the First Team orchard, so to
speak, acted as if they thought themselves real timber!
It was well-nigh sickening to First Team sensibilities,
and so the First Team set itself to inflict disciplinary
punishment. For a while it seemed that the Scrub
was due to emerge from the engagement with a
chastened spirit, but that was only for a while, and
a brief while at that. Having allowed the First<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
to reach the fourteen yards, though far from willingly,
the Scrub dug its cleats, and gave an excellent imitation
of a stone wall. Against that wall Quarterback
Stoddard dashed Fargo and Jensen and Fargo again,
and when the three attempts had been made the wall
was scarcely dented. The First was plainly puzzled;
puzzled and angry too. But that any Scrub—at least
any Scrub so recently born—could actually hold the
first for four downs was unthinkable, and so, scorning
to be satisfied with the three points a field-goal
would have given, Stoddard unwisely pulled Captain
Lothrop out of the line and instructed him, by means
of signals, to bust through and put the ball down not
short of the four yards. Unfortunately, Stoddard lost
track of the fact that Dave’s place at left guard was
being handed over to Sproule, playing half instead
of Whitemill. When the ball was snapped, Clem Henning
drew Sproule forward on his nose, strode over
him and stopped Captain Dave neatly and expeditiously
for a gain of some eighteen inches. Dazed, First
yielded the pigskin.</p>

<p>Any one knows that the only thing to do when the
ball comes into your possession close to your goal is
to punt it away from there. So Sim did something
else! He called “Kemble back!” the ball was shot to
Tom from center, and Tom took three steps back and
to his left, and swept the pigskin down the field with
an overhand spiral throw. Clif had let the opposing
end by outside, evaded a back and was clear. Not far
behind him ran Sim. Toward them both came the ball.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Sim turned, looked and panted: “Take it!” Clif
whirled, stood and held his hands out. Never before
in a contest had he ever attempted a long catch of a
forward-pass, and he wished devoutly that the ball
had gone to Sim. Without seeing he knew that the
whole field of players was converging on him. Then
the ball struck his hands, and by some miracle, as it
seemed to him, stuck! Turning quickly, he had a
blurred vision of Sim crashing into an opponent. The
background of the brief picture was a confusion of
moving bodies, looming larger with each instant.</p>

<p>Then he dug out, the ball tucked firmly between arm
and body, his right hand outstretched for action. He
could run, could Clif, and he ran now, but there was
the First Team quarter bearing diagonally across to
intercept him, and the fleet Jensen was close behind.
It seemed to Clif that he had taken but a dozen strides
when Jensen shot for him, and, despite his plunge to
the right, caught him, and brought him crashing down,
and yet when he was pulled, breathless, to his feet a
moment later, there was the fifty-yard line behind the
ball! Somehow he had successfully caught a thirty-yard
pass, and carried it seventeen yards further! The
Scrub assailed him as one man, and did him painful
honor!</p>

<p>The First was disgruntled, and Mr. Otis’s disgusted
observations did little to soothe it. Tom, smiting Clif
mightily between his shoulders and depriving him momentarily
of what little breath he had left after being
thumped to earth by Stoddard, and sat on by Jensen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
grinned expansively and shouted “Good stuff, old
son! That’s the way to treat ’em!”</p>

<p>Sim called on Thayer for a fullback buck and
Johnny was piled up with a sickening thud. The First
was through with nonsense! Stiles tried to slip off
tackle, and was thrown for a loss, but a too-eager First
Team end had been off-side and the ball went to the
forty-four, and it was still second down. Stiles tried
the same play again and got a yard. Kemble went back
and Sim cut through for three. Kemble punted to the
five-yard line, and Jensen ran the ball back to the
seventeen.</p>

<p>Fargo made two and then four through Greene.
Sproule, on an end run, added two more and Fargo
punted short to the Scrub’s forty-six, where the ball
went out. Adams lost three yards on an end-round
play. Kemble went back to punting position, and, with
a widespread formation, hurled to the left for twelve
yards, where Stiles pulled it down, only to lose it.
Thayer took Kemble’s place up-field, but the ball went
to Kemble instead, and he raced back behind Thayer
and again threw forward, this time far down the field.
The throw was hurried, for the First piled through
desperately, and were all around Tom when the ball
got away. Thayer, however, did good work as defense,
and the pass reached its destination. The destination
was Jeff Adams, right end. Jeff had crossed behind
the enemy, and was uncovered. The rest is history.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<small>AN “UNEXPECTED” HONOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jeff had just twenty-eight yards to go for a
touchdown, and he covered twenty-two of them
before he was threatened. Then Drayton, right
end, overhauled him. But after the tackle Jeff made
three good yards, and when the whistle sounded, the
pigskin lay no more than four feet from the last whitewashed
streak. A horn tooted hoarsely, but “G.G.”
would have none of it.</p>

<p>“Play on,” he ordered grimly. “Two minutes more,
First!”</p>

<p>The Scrub exulted. They would have cheered Mr.
Otis if there had been time. The First set grimly to
work to hold the enemy at bay, and Thayer’s first
smash at the line netted inches only. But neither Sim
nor the big fullback was discouraged. Four feet was
only four feet, and Johnny could take that in a stride!
But he had to have a hole, and the center of the First’s
panting, crouching line offered not even a crevice. So
Sim shifted to his right, playing beyond end himself,
and the Scrub drove straight ahead, wedging between
guard and tackle, and Thayer shot up and forward, and
the whistle blew and the ball was over!</p>

<p>To make assurances doubly sure, Sim Jackson gave
way to Hoppin, and “Hop,” standing safely away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
from his line, took a long and rather ragged pass from
“Babe” Ridgway, and toed it neatly over the bar.
And the Scrub had scored on the First—the real, honest-to-goodness
First, and not a mess of substitutes—and
every one was happy. Every one, that is, except
the First!</p>

<p>The period ended a minute later, and the Scrub went
carousing away to the lee of the stand and pulled
blankets about them, and talked it all over gleefully.
Perhaps they made more of it than it was worth, both
then and later, but, on the other hand, perhaps they
didn’t. It might, you see, be a long, long time before
they had another chance to celebrate any such decisive
victory as they had scored that day!</p>

<p>There was more to follow, but it wasn’t likely that
Mr. Otis would put the same line-up back. Nor did
he. A few first string forwards faced the Scrub in
the second scrimmage, but they melted away as time
went on, giving place to substitutes until at last a
whole new team fought for the honor of the First.
And Mr. Babcock freshened his bunch, too. He didn’t
have enough men for a whole new team, but he did
the best he could, and only Clem Henning and “Wink”
Coles played to the end. Clif didn’t see any work in
that session, while Tom dropped out soon after the
start to make way for Ike Patch. They crouched together,
bundled under their own blankets and another,
and watched intensely. To you or me that second
scrimmage wouldn’t have proved very interesting. In
fact, I doubt if either of us would have stayed two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
minutes out there in that chilling gale. But Clif and
Tom found the spectacle a most thrilling one, groaning
when “Swede” Hanbury, the second-string full
back, romped through the Scrub for twelve long yards
and exulting shrilly when “Wink” plunged through
and fell on a fumbled ball at a moment when disaster
threatened the Scrub, seven yards from its goal. Yes,
though neither side scored, though misplays were frequent
and opportunities wasted, Clif and Tom found
the contest heart-filling enough.</p>

<p>That evening the Scrub was carelessly enough christened
with a name that stuck the season through. Some
unknown witness of the afternoon’s struggle uttered
the phrase, and it met with favor from a listener, and
was repeated, probably as his own, and by the next
afternoon it had captured popularity, and written itself
into school language. After that it was never, save
officially or in the polite pages of <cite>The Lantern</cite>, “Mr.
Babcock’s Team.” Nor was it the “Second.” It was
the “Fighting Scrub.”</p>

<p>That was a name to live up to, and the Scrub, from
Adams to Tyson, taking it alphabetically, resolved to
merit it. Mr. Babcock smiled in his sleeve. He believed
in fight. Fighting, though, won’t always win,
especially if the odds against the fighter are long. And
if the Scrub thought to repeat its victory of Thursday
right away it was doomed to disappointment. Because
on Friday, during the brief ten minutes of real scrimmage
that took place, the First, having knocked together
a hasty and temporary defense against forward-passes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
seized the Scrub by the nape of its neck and
fairly wiped up the gridiron with it. Smarting under
the defeat of the day before, and the gibes of its schoolmates,
it sought vengeance and obtained it in handfulls.
It scored two touchdowns and followed the
second with a goal, and later, in the gymnasium, held
up thirteen points for the infuriation of the Scrub.
The Scrub, which had “rubbed it in” good and hard
yesterday, tried its best to grin and found the effort
painful.</p>

<p>That evening twenty youths crowded into Clem Henning’s
room, which he shared with Jimmy Ames, and,
occupying practically every horizontal surface therein,
set about the election of a captain. A week before the
undertaking had not seemed important. Any fellow
would do; especially Clem, who was already holding
down the job temporarily. But since a week ago the
lowly Scrub had become the Fighting Scrub. It had
seen service, acquired traditions, and won honor. It
was no longer merely twenty youths brought together
by chance. It was a fellowship, a fraternity, a shoulder-to-shoulder
clan. It was—well, it was the Fighting
Scrub! And so the election of a leader had
suddenly become a matter of vast importance, something
to be done carefully, and only after much
thought.</p>

<p>A good deal of the thinking had been done by Tom,
and he had shared some of his thoughts with Clif.
But not all, as it turned out. “I was talking with Clem
Henning this afternoon,” Tom announced on Wednesday,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
“and he says he doesn’t want to be captain.
Says he won’t be if he has to.”</p>

<p>“Guess it will be Coles, then,” said Clif.</p>

<p>“Coles is all right. But how about Jimmy Ames?”</p>

<p>“Ames? Why, I don’t know. I like Coles better.
Or Stiles.”</p>

<p>“Stiles, eh? We-ell, yes, maybe. You know, Clif,
I wouldn’t say no if they offered it to me.”</p>

<p>“Offered what?”</p>

<p>“Captaincy.”</p>

<p>“A fat chance,” jeered Clif. “One of the old fellows
will get it, of course. Henning ought to take it.
He’s a First Class fellow. Either he or Ames.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that it matters what your class is,” Tom
demurred. “I’m not saying I’m expecting to get it,
of course, but if some one nominated me I’ll bet I’d
get four or five votes. It would be fun to see, eh?”</p>

<p>But Clif didn’t enthuse greatly. “That may be
your idea of fun, Tom, but it isn’t mine. To stand
for election just to see yourself licked is crazy.”</p>

<p>“Heck, what’s the difference if you are licked? Say,
if any of the crowd should put me up, vote for me once
anyway, like a good guy, will you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll second the nomination, if it’s done,” laughed
Clif, “but I’d like to know who you think’s going to
put you up!”</p>

<p>“Well, some one might. You can’t tell. Some one
might do it just to be funny.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be so blamed funny,” said
Clif, slightly indignant. “If it comes right down to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
brass tacks, I guess you’d make a good enough captain—with
me to help you!”</p>

<p>Mr. Babcock had declined an invitation to be present
on the momentous occasion, and so it was Clem
Henning who coughed loudly, and said that they were
there to elect a captain, and he guessed they’d better
get at it, and that so far as he was concerned, he
was out of it entirely because he didn’t know how to
be a captain, and it was too pesky much trouble anyway!</p>

<p>Much protestation followed, some of it perhaps polite
rather than sincere, and several fellows tried to talk
at once. “Wink” Coles finally got a hearing, and
declared that Clem was the man for the job, and why
not elect him, and pay no attention to what he said.
Gillespie, known as “Gilly,” got quite eloquent, and
reminded them that they should elect one of their number
who possessed the gift of leadership, and placed
in nomination Pat Tyson. The applause was rather
for the eloquence than the nominee, it seemed. Then
Jackson proposed “Babe” Ridgway and “Babe” declined
in a panic. After that proceedings slowed up.
Clif, observing Tom, laughed to himself. Although
Tom seemed to have not a care in the world, Clif
thought he could detect anxiety. Evidently it occurred
to no one to nominate Tom, even as a joke,
and Clif was wondering whether to do it himself when
Thayer was offered as a candidate. The applause was
flattering, but the meeting had certainly not been
stampeded, and Johnny, himself, was rewarding his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
sponsor with a malignant scowl. Clem spoke again
from his precarious seat on the radiator—which, fortunately,
was not radiating to-night—and suggested
that they get busy and do something, because it would
be study hour in about ten minutes.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better ballot. Jimmy, tear up a couple
of sheets of paper from my block, will you? So far
the candidates are Tyson, Ridgway—”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” protested “Babe.”</p>

<p>“—and Thayer. But I’m going to nominate another.
I like the captain to be a backfield chap. After
that he ought to play well enough to be certain of his
place (laughter), and he ought to have a whole lot
of fight and pep. In fact—” and Clem’s eyes twinkled—“he
ought to be a fellow who can go after what
he wants and get it. I nominate Kemble.”</p>

<p>There was a brief instant of surprise, surprise
plainly, oh, so plainly shared by Tom! Then came an
astonishing amount of applause, astonishing at least
to Clif, who was reprehensibly late in joining in it.
Tom was shaking his head, not so much negatively as
doubtfully. “Heck, fellows, I’m new around here,
and I guess you want a fellow who’s been here longer.
Henning says he won’t take it, but if we show him we
need him—”</p>

<p>“I’m out,” declared Clem, grinning across at Tom.
“Let’s vote.”</p>

<p>Jimmy Ames distributed slips of paper, pens and
pencils passed from hand to hand, and “Wink” started
some one’s cap around, and the slips dropped in. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Jimmy dumped the ballots on the bed, and Clem prepared
to tabulate them on the back of an envelope exhumed
from a pocket. Lou Stiles interrupted proceedings.</p>

<p>“Hold on a sec! How are we doing this? Does a
majority elect or a plurality or what?”</p>

<p>“Plurality,” decided Clem, and as no one dissented—although
Leo Gosman wanted anxiously to know
what a plurality was—the counting proceeded, and
after a minute, Clif read the result. “Ridgway gets
four,” announced Clif, “Kemble ten and Tyson six.
Kemble is elected. The meeting’s adjourned <i lang="la">sine die</i>,
<i lang="la">pro tem</i> and <i lang="la">e pluribus unum</i>!”</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how,” responded Tom, grinning.
“Besides, there isn’t time. But I want to say that I
thank you fellows for the honor, and that I’ll do my
best to help you put the Fighting Scrub on the map.
I don’t deserve the captaincy, of course; most any of
the rest of you would have been better; but I’ll certainly
try to deserve the—er—unexpected honor.
That’s all, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said “Babe.” “Let’s make it unanimous,
fellows. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I’ll second that,” declared Pat Tyson good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Moved and seconded—”</p>

<p>“You can’t! The meeting’s adjourned,” laughed
some one.</p>

<p>“Forget it! Kemble is unanimously elected Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
of the Wyndham—no, of the Fighting Scrub, and
may Heaven help him!”</p>

<p>To which sentiment the party laughingly dissolved,
hurrying off to arm themselves for study hour.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see how it happened,” said Clif as
he and Tom went back to West. “It’s great, Tom, and
I’m awfully pleased, but I certainly was surprised!”</p>

<p>“It was a regular bolt from the blue,” agreed Tom
gravely. “Look here, did you vote for me?”</p>

<p>“Of course I did!”</p>

<p>“That’s funny then.”</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“I had eleven votes pledged and only got ten. Some
lowlife went back on me!”</p>

<p>“You had eleven—” A light broke on Clif. “Why—why,”
he sputtered at last, “you blamed old fox!
Do you mean to say that you knew all the time—”</p>

<p>“Well, I couldn’t be sure,” Tom chuckled. “As it
was, one of my pledges got away. But I sort of expected,
Clif.”</p>

<p>“You—you politician! How’d you do it?”</p>

<p>“Just got them to promise to vote for me in case
my name was proposed. They didn’t think it would
be, of course.”</p>

<p>“I should say not! But how did—how’d it happen
that Henning nominated you?”</p>

<p>“Henning thought I was the right fellow for the
job,” replied Tom tranquilly.</p>

<p>“He did, eh? I’d like to know where he got that—”</p>

<p>“Some one told him, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“Some one! Huh! The some one was you, then,
I’ll bet! Say—”</p>

<p>But Tom was half-way up the stairs and Clif’s remarks
were curtailed. Turning toward Number 17,
he shook his head helplessly. Then, however, he
chuckled.</p>

<p>After study hour Clif persuaded Tom to accompany
him to Mr. McKnight’s. This was the evening of
what “Lovey” called his “shindig.” Clif had visited
his adviser several times since that first conference, but
had never managed to attend one of the Friday night
gatherings. Tom was far from enthusiastic, but
yielded to his chum’s pleas. Besides, Clif accused him
of duplicity and deceit, and several other dreadful
things in connection with his election to the Scrub
captaincy, and perhaps Tom felt that he owed Clif
something in the way of apology. They found only
eight others in Number 19 when they arrived; eight,
that is, beside the instructor. During the next few
minutes the number was augmented by the arrival of
an attenuated youth with a surprisingly long neck and
prominent Adam’s apple, which leaped convulsively
when he talked, and a Junior who was painfully embarrassed,
and spent the hour voiceless in a corner.</p>

<p>At first the guests looked to be a motley crowd, but
after a while Clif concluded that there was nothing out
of the ordinary about them. They represented, he
decided, the non-athletic element of the school; or, to
put it more fairly, the intellectual element. Tom was
plainly sorry he had come. Introductions were necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
in many cases, though some of the fellows already
claimed nodding acquaintance with the two.
Mr. McKnight had already learned of Tom’s election
and congratulated him very warmly, thereby spreading
the news throughout the study. The youth with
the agitated Adam’s apple, whose name proved to be,
appropriately enough, Baldwin, and whom Tom ever
after alluded to as “The Pippin,” insisted on shaking
hands a second time with Tom and “felicitating” him.
Baldwin modestly claimed brotherhood with Tom by
reason of being somewhat athletic himself, having
played last year on the Second Class Tennis Team.
Whereupon Tom said: “Fine! Tennis is a great
game. And I like croquet, too, Baldwin.” Baldwin
agreed that croquet was doubtless an interesting pastime,
but you could plainly see that he resented having
it placed on a level with tennis.</p>

<p>“Lovey” went to the piano and played something
that sounded extremely difficult, and horribly mixed-up.
Clif enjoyed watching his hands, though. Evidently
Mr. McKnight could play well, but Clif was relieved
when he broke into a popular song and, setting the
example in a good baritone, persuaded most of the company
to sing. There were three or four vocal selections
rendered, and then “Lovey” moved a small table
into the center of the big, soft rug, and served refreshments
of sandwiches and cake, and lemonade. Eating
appeared to loosen the tongues of the “intellectuals,”
and soon at least four debates were under way. Baldwin,
half a sandwich poised in his right hand, a glass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of lemonade in the other, stood before the empty grate
and deplored the lack of opportunity for self-expression
at Wyndham. Neither Clif nor Tom could hear
him very well, but Tom stared fascinatedly at his
throat, and murmured, “There it goes! Look at it!
Up! Down! Up! Heck, he’s swallowed it!”</p>

<p>But he hadn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. McKnight sat down by Clif and talked football
a while. He seemed to know a great deal about
it, and presently Tom was weaned from his absorbed
occupation of watching Baldwin, and took part in the
talk. “Lovey” told them he hoped the Scrub would
be as good this year as it had been last. “Babcock’s
a clever coach, fellows. He’s taken some mighty unpromising
material before this and turned out an
excellent team.” Noting Tom’s grin, the instructor
hastily amended. “I didn’t mean to say it just that
way, Kemble,” he laughed. “From what I’ve heard
and seen of his material this fall he’s rather better off
than usual. To my thinking Babcock would make a
fine First Team coach in case Mr. Otis failed us. Of
course, though, he couldn’t give the time to it. Even
now he’s pretty hard pressed to coach you chaps.”</p>

<p>“He’s an awfully good coach, I think,” agreed Clif.
“He gets you to do things without telling you to,
somehow. I mean, you want to please him, you know,
and so you—you sort of just do things without waiting
to be told!”</p>

<p>“That’s very true, Clif,” agreed Mr. McKnight.
“He has always been able to win coöperation. We were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
at college together, although I knew him only slightly.
He was a class ahead of me. But it was so with everything
he went into there. They made him captain of the
Senior eleven his last year, and he went in and won the
class championship. It’s like pulling teeth without gas
to get a senior to come out and practice for football,
but Babcock did it somehow, and they licked the sophomores
first, and then tackled us after we had nosed
out ahead of the freshmen. Of course we expected
to beat them badly, and every one else expected us to,
but Babcock worked up a cheering section with plenty
of tin pans, and watchman’s rattles—noise was always
part of the game—and held us for the first half. I
was only a substitute and didn’t get into the fun until
the last minute. We got a field-goal in the third
quarter, and thought we had the class championship
won. But along toward the last of it Babcock called for
time and got his crowd together and gave instructions.
They had been using only six or eight old plays, and
we’d had no trouble guessing what was coming. We
could see Babcock making a sort of diagram with
his finger on the ground, and the others bending over
and watching, and we laughed, and our crowd on the
side-line made fun of them. Then they came back and
spread themselves all across the field in a ridiculous
sort of formation, with only two men behind the line.
Of course we spread out to cover them, and played
our center back, and got all set for a tricky pass. But
we were all wrong. Their quarterback took the ball,
and came straight through with it, and, as we were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
wide open, he had a good start with two men making
interference for him before we found out what was
happening. We chased him sixty-odd yards, but every
time one of us thought we had him, a Senior would
crowd us off, and send us tumbling, and he went over
right between the goal-posts—that was in the days of
the free-try for goal—and so they licked us, seven to
three. Babcock has told me since that he knew the
only way to beat us was to get our forward line open,
and that all that instruction and diagram stuff was
merely bluff. All the instruction he gave was to the
quarter. ‘Take the ball,’ he said, ‘and run it straight
down for a score.’”</p>

<small>CLIF GOES FOR A PAPER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The First Team played its game away from
home on Saturday, meeting Minster High
School at Minster, and so, at three o’clock,
the Scrub lined up against Freeburg High School on
the First Team gridiron. A goodly portion of the
student body had followed the school eleven, but
enough fellows had remained at home to form, with
a large delegation of high school boys and girls, a
very respectable audience. Doctor Wyndham attended
and remained until the third period was well along, and
the issue had been definitely settled. Others of the
faculty graced the occasion, too, and Mr. McKnight
and Mr. Connover joined “Cocky” on the bench. The
cold spell had passed, and the weather, clear and moderately
warm, with almost no breeze, was ideal for
football.</p>

<p>The First Team had beaten the local high school by
the score of 19 to 7, and “Cocky’s” charges were certain
of their ability to triumph, although none predicted
better than a close victory. Mr. Babcock started
Adams, Ames, Howlett, Ridgway, Henning, Coles and
Bingham in the line, and Jackson, Kemble, Gillespie
and Thayer in the backfield. It was evident almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
from the first that the Scrub was by far the better
team, with a sturdier defense, and a harder and more
varied attack. Thayer went over for the first touchdown
less than six minutes after play had begun, subsequent
to a straight march down the field in which
the Scrub opened wide gaps in the High School line,
ran the ends for good gains and pulled off one forward-pass,
Kemble to Bingham. Later, the Scrub
started a second advance, after an exchange of punts
had gained a few yards for the home team, and had
reached High School’s twenty-five-yard line when the
whistle blew. Scrub lost the ball on the seventeen,
when play had been resumed, by Thayer’s failure to
find an opening. Two inches more would have won
a first down. High School rushed once and then
punted to Jackson in midfield and Sim scampered back
sixteen yards before he was stopped. Scrub took up
its journey again and pushed the ball across near the
corner of the field, Kemble carrying it. Sim had
missed the first try-for-point, but he succeeded this
time and the Scrub had the game 13 to 0.</p>

<p>The half ended with no more scoring and with
High School still on the defensive.</p>

<p>Gosman went in for Adams when the third period
began, and Ike Patch took Clif’s place at the other
end. Later, other changes were made until “Cocky’s”
complete roster had seen service. Duval, who played
quarter in the last period, handled the team so well
that Sim Jackson looked distinctly anxious! High
School threatened once in the third quarter, getting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
the ball to Scrub’s twenty-one, but the home team
stiffened and High School’s attempt at a field-goal was
knocked down by “Babe” and captured on the thirty-four
yards by McMurtry. Scrub worked back to the
enemy’s thirty-three with two good forward-passes,
a long run by Stiles, back at right half, and some good
line plunging by Hoppin and Kemble. But on the
thirty-three Stiles fumbled and, although he recovered
the ball, Scrub was set back twelve yards. Three tries,
one of them a forward-pass that grounded, gained but
six yards and Tom punted over the line.</p>

<p>High School kept the ball from the twenty-yard
line to midfield where a long forward-pass was intercepted
by “Wink” Coles, and carried to the enemy’s
thirty-eight. “Wink” got knocked breathless in the
proceeding, and time was called. Heard took his
place. The quarter ended after the next play. In
the last period Scrub again nearly secured a touchdown,
but down on High School’s twelve yards some one
mixed the signals and a four-yard loss resulted. On
the subsequent play Scrub was off-side and the pigskin
again went back. Finally, with five yards to go
on third down, Tom tried a forward heave to Stiles
that grounded behind the line. That was the final
threat by either side and some fifteen minutes later the
last whistle sounded, the score still 13 to 0.</p>

<p>Over at Minster the First had won a somewhat hollow
victory to the tune of 26 to 6, and so Wyndham
could crow that Saturday evening. The First Team,
arriving in the dining hall practically in a body some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
fifteen minutes after supper had begun, received a
salvo of hand-clapping as it made its way to the two
training tables at the end of the room. The Scrub,
distributed here and there about the hall, received no
applause, but every member of it knew where glory
really belonged! Hadn’t they completely shut out a
team that had scored on the First, but a fortnight ago?
They had! Well, then!</p>

<p>Besides, if Charlie Duval hadn’t called for a pass
over the line that time, if he had let Kemble shoot the
ball over the end, why, it was dollars to doughnuts
they’d have had another score. Or if Stiles hadn’t
fumbled on High School’s thirty-three before that—
Why, any one could see that Scrub’s total ought really
to have been 19, at least; maybe 20; and 19 was all
that the First had been able to make against High
School! Then just because the First ran up a 26 to
6 score against a weak team over at Minster every one
had to go crazy about it! Huh!</p>

<p>At Wyndham you made an arrangement with a
citizen of Greek birth named—well, no one could
pronounce his name in its entirety, but you called
him “Poppy,” which was about a quarter of the whole—for
your Sunday paper. “Poppy” delivered it, along
with some forty others, at the entrance. After breakfast—before
if you had time—you went and got it.
“Poppy,” however, didn’t attempt to mark each subscriber’s
name on his paper. He merely delivered the
required assortment, and let you do your own selecting.
Nine times out of ten you got a paper. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
it wasn’t the one you had ordered, but it was
better than none, and after you had read it you exchanged
with some one else for the one you preferred.
But on the Sunday morning following the Scrub’s
glorious victory over Freeburg High School, a victory
he had talked over the evening before until his throat
had become dry, Clif found only two papers left, one
a Boston publication, and the other, boasting not even
a colored supplement, a stingy thing from the state
capital.</p>

<p>“I might have known I’d get left if I came down
this late,” mourned Clif. He had tarried upstairs to
collect his laundry, and make out the list, a duty generally
put off until later in the morning. He picked
up the Boston paper tentatively, shook his head, and
laid it down again just as its rightful owner appeared,
viewing Clif with deep suspicion. There was plenty
of time to go to the village if he could get permission,
and he ascended the stairs again and sought Number
19. There Mr. McKnight, after politely offering Clif
the use of his own New York <cite>Times</cite>, signed his name
to a gray slip of paper and Clif started for the village.</p>

<p>It was quite warm this morning, much warmer than
yesterday, and the sun turned the yellowing maples
and birches to pure gold. The elms along the drive
were already littering the gravel with their rusty brown
leaves. It was a lazy sort of a day, and Clif’s steps,
once he was in the fuller sunlight of Oak Street, grew
slower and slower, until he was fairly dawdling along.
He was still dawdling when he crossed Hubbard Street<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
and passed the Inn, before which several visiting automobiles
were parked. His thoughts went back to a
week ago, and his father’s visit, and the drive to Cotterville,
and he was almost to State Street, beyond
which, on the other side of Oak, “Poppy’s” combined
fruit, candy, and news emporium stood, when something
claimed his interest, and brought his thoughts
back to the present.</p>

<p>The something was a wheel chair which was being
slowly propelled along the sidewalk by its occupant.
At the distance of half a block Loring Deane was
easily recognizable and Clif wondered at finding the
boy alone so far from the school. Evidently he, too,
had been to “Poppy’s” for the sunlight shone garishly
on the colored outer section of the paper in his lap.
Approaching, although on the opposite side of Oak
Street, Clif considered offering his assistance again.
It was a long way back to school, and he didn’t see
how Deane could manage the curbings. But he did
see a moment later, for the wheel chair came to a place
where the sidewalk sloped to meet the street level at the
entrance of a narrow alley, and the occupant turned
his vehicle to the right, eased it down the short descent,
and headed obliquely toward the State Street intersection
and Clif.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll offer to push him back,” thought Clif.
“He won’t mind waiting while I get my paper.” He
had already started to put the thought to action when
an automobile came charging eastward through State
Street. Involuntarily Clif drew back from the curbing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Then a motion of the arms grasping the wheel
of the car sent Clif’s heart into his throat. The driver
was going to swing south, had already slowed slightly
and was turning the steering wheel hard to the right.
Squarely in the middle of the street was the wheel
chair. Its occupant, unaware of the danger an instant
before, now heard, and saw the car lurching
around the corner scarcely forty feet away. For a moment
irresolution stayed the hands on the wheels.
Then, bending forward, Loring strove desperately
to roll the chair to safety.</p>

<p>All this Clif saw ere he dashed forward. As he
raced toward the boy in the chair, he was aware of
the throbbing of the big automobile almost beside him,
heard a spasmodic blast from the horn, and the screeching
of hastily applied brakes. Then he had reached
the chair and seized one arm of it, dragging it frantically
toward the sidewalk. Almost simultaneously
something huge and black rushed past, the wheel chair
was almost wrenched from his grasp, there was a sharp
report, and the metallic sound of crashing glass and
silence!</p>

<p>Coming swiftly, the car had been unable to make
the turn abruptly, and had swung well toward the left
side of Oak Street. The building on the corner had
obscured the driver’s view of what lay ahead until he
had started to turn. Then he had desperately avoided
the wheel chair by swerving hard to the right, grazing
the object in passing and, in spite of brakes, had
swung onto the sidewalk, demolishing an iron hitching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
post—perhaps Freeburg’s last reminder of the
Horse Age—and plunged obliquely into the front of
“Poppy’s” emporium! When, dazedly, Clif looked,
the farther sidewalk was strewed with papers and
oranges and shattered glass, and splintered boxes and
“Poppy” himself, white-faced but voluble, was shaking
a huge fist in the face of the scared driver.</p>

<p>Two minutes before it would have been difficult to
count a dozen persons on the whole length of Oak
Street. Now thrice that many were gathered about the
scene of the accident and every instant saw the number
increase. Clif’s gaze dropped to Loring Deane.
The latter was looking up at him questioningly. His
face was pale, but he was smiling bravely enough.</p>

<p>“What happened?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Plenty,” answered Clif grimly. He swung the
chair around so that its occupant could see for himself.
The driver of the badly damaged car had
alighted, but in the rear seat two frightened women
were staring strainedly about them. The town constable,
stiffly attired for church, had arrived, and his
thin, indignantly high-pitched voice was to be heard
above the excited chatter of the throng. “You was
goin’ too fast! I seen you! You was goin’ too fast!”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” said Loring. “It was my fault.”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t,” Clif protested. “That man came
around the corner at twenty miles an hour, easy. He
was hitting thirty until he started to turn! It’s a
wonder he didn’t get you, Deane. He’s smashed the
handles clean off.” Clif retrieved the broken part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
from the asphalt. It didn’t look to be of any further
use, however, and he tossed it into the gutter.</p>

<p>“He was driving too fast,” Loring was saying, “but
I shouldn’t have gone into the street alone. I told
Wattles I’d stay there until he got back.”</p>

<p>“Wattles? Is that the man who pushes you around?
Well, what’s become of him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Loring shook his head perplexedly.
It wasn’t like the faithful Wattles to remain away
at such a time. “He went across to the drug store.
Perhaps he’s over there.” Loring nodded across the
street.</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can find him.” Clif wasn’t averse to
seeing how the car had fared, and how badly “Poppy’s”
store had suffered. “I’ll pull you up on the sidewalk
first, though.” He did so, not without difficulty, and
started away. “I’ll be back in a second,” he called.
“If I can’t find him I’ll push you home.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but he’s sure to be here soon,” answered
Loring.</p>

<p>Clif had to push hard to get within viewing distance
of the car since by now all Freeburg—at least,
all of male Freeburg—had reached the scene. The
car’s driver and the constable and “Poppy” were in
consultation. “Poppy” was calmer, but there was that
in his handsome, brigandish countenance which told
Clif that he would suffer no financial loss by reason of
the accident. Underfoot Sunday papers ruffled, and
golden oranges and glistening apples were being salvaged
by willing hands. “Poppy’s” front and side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
windows were ruins, for the heavy car had struck
fairly at the angle of sidewalk and entrance. The
car itself was sadly damaged, although on close inspection
Clif decided that it had got off pretty well.
Collision with the iron post had simultaneously demolished
post, and car bumper, and the subsequent
impact had crumpled in the radiator, and torn away
one mudguard. Also one wheel was broken. The
constable began to look for witnesses and Clif edged
swiftly toward the outer rim of the throng. The
missing Wattles was not to be seen. He hurried
back across the street, now fairly choked by automobiles,
and saw a man in a black brilliantine coat conversing
with Loring Deane.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you’d mind pushing me back to the
drugstore,” said Loring as Clif joined him. “Poor
old Wattles has fainted, he says.”</p>

<p>The drug clerk assented, his gaze darting curiously
across the street. “Yeah, he was just going out when
the smash came, and he dropped in a heap. We got
him ’round all right in a jiffy, but he’s still sort of
wobbly. I’ll run across and see what’s happened.”</p>

<p>Wattles was a woebegone looking object when they
reached the drug store. Seated decorously erect in a
chair, his derby clasped fixedly on his knees, he was
the color of yellow parchment and his long face was
the unhappiest thing Clif had ever seen. Even when
the wheel chair rolled toward him Wattles’s gloom
failed to lighten. He moistened his lips with an effort
and:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to have done it, Mister Loring,” he
croaked. “You ought never to have done it. What
would I have said to your father, sir, if—if—”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” agreed Loring soothingly. “I
shouldn’t have done it, Wattles. How are you feeling
now?”</p>

<p>“Better, sir, thanks. But, Mister Loring, when I
looked up the street, and saw that automobile right
atop of you, like, I—I had a frightful shock, sir! I
really did! I just went right off!”</p>

<p>“Too bad, Wattles. I’m beastly sorry. Look here,
you’d better not try to walk back. Bingham here
will look after me. I’ll see if we can’t get a lift for
you.”</p>

<p>But Wattles arose superbly, even majestically—if
also somewhat unsteadily—and placed his hat determinedly
on his head. “Oh, no, sir, I’m quite all right
now! It was merely—merely momentary, sir. The
air will quite restore me, Mister Loring.”</p>

<p>Loring looked doubtful and turned to Clif for an
opinion, but Clif had been engaged in conversation by
Mr. Burger, the proprietor, eager to learn about the
accident, and whether any one had been injured. So
Loring consented to Wattles’ return afoot and, after
thanking the proprietor, the three departed. Wattles’
return to normal was instant when he had reached the
sidewalk, and may have been due to any one of three
things or a combination of all; the interesting spectacle
across the street, the revivifying influence of
fresh air or the shocking discovery that the handle-bar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
by which he had so long manipulated the chair,
was totally missing. Personally I think it was the
latter, for Wattles seemed absolutely unable to reconcile
himself to the loss of the handle, and propelled the
chair in such an erratic, zig-zag fashion that Clif insisted
on taking his place. Wattles, murmuring feeble,
embarrassed protests, gave way and Clif became the
motive power.</p>

<p>Fortunately public interest was so entirely centered
about the battered car, and more battered store that
no one paid heed to the disappearance of two of the
most important witnesses to the affair. For his part,
Clif had no desire to be called on to testify against
the driver of the car. The latter had undeniably been
at fault, but Clif was pretty certain that to-day’s lesson
would cure him of taking blind corners at high
speed. After he had paid for “Poppy’s” store, and
for reckless driving, and for repairs to his car, he
would be, Clif concluded, both a poorer and a wiser
man. Thought of “Poppy’s” emporium recalled to
mind the fact that he was returning to school minus
the object of his expedition, the Sunday paper, and
when, just then, he discovered that what he had sought
lay spread across Loring Deane’s knees, on top of the
ever-present dark plaid robe, he chuckled.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to lend me your paper, Deane,
when you’re through with it,” he said. “That’s what
I went to the village for, but ‘Poppy’s’ stock was pretty
well shop-worn by the time I got there!”</p>

<p>“I’d like you to read it first,” answered Loring. “In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
fact, I don’t care if I don’t see it at all. I get it more
for Wattles than myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thanks, but I would like to see it when
you’ve finished. There won’t be much chance for
papers, anyway, before dinner, for it’s pretty close
to church time now.”</p>

<p>“Well, but I’d rather you took it first,” Loring insisted.
“You know—you know, Bingham, you saved
my life, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Rot! You’d have made it all right even if I
hadn’t butted in. Well—” and this was to switch the
conversation from so embarrassing a subject—“I’ll
take it first, if you’re sure you won’t mind. I’ll give
it back to you this afternoon. You’re in that room of
Mr. Clendenin’s, aren’t you, on the first corridor in
East?”</p>

<p>“Yes, between his office and the game room. Doctor
Wyndham let me have it because it’s rather hard to
get up and down the stairs so often. By the way,
Wattles, you’d better see about a new chair the first
thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>Wattles, walking slightly in the rear, had, it appeared,
already given thought to the subject. “I think,
Mister Loring, we can rent a chair temporarily while
this is being repaired. I understand there’s a very
capable cabinet maker in the town, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Loring, “but seems to me what
we need is a carriage maker, Wattles. Anyhow, you
see what you can do. We may have to telegraph to
New York, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>Clif yielded the chair to Wattles at the West Hall
entrance, and, much to his confusion, since a half-dozen
fellows were looking on over the tops of their
papers, Loring held his hand out. Clif took it, uncomfortably
aware of the curious stares of the audience,
and discovered that Loring Deane, whatever his
physical disabilities might be, had plenty of strength
in his fingers. Loring smiled, but rather gravely,
and “Thanks, Bingham,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“Shucks, that’s all right,” said Clif hastily, and
got his hand back feeling rather as if it had been just
drawn from a vise. “I don’t believe I helped much.
Well, see you later. I’ll bring this back by three,
sure.”</p>

<p>“Keep it as long as you want,” answered Loring.
“Don’t return it at all unless you want to, although I
hope you will because I’d like to have a visit from
you.”</p>

<p>“Why, I—sure, I’ll be around.”</p>

<p>Wattles pushed the chair on toward East Hall, and
Clif, swinging the paper ostentatiously, picked his
way up the steps, nodding here and there, certain that
as soon as he was beyond hearing the group would
join in an effort to find an explanation of that ceremonious
hand shake. Going to his room Clif wished
impatiently that Deane hadn’t staged that silly scene
out there. There’d be all sorts of crazy stories around
the Hall as a result. School was a gossipy hole, anyway.
But by the time he had triumphantly tossed
the paper into Walter’s lap he had become more lenient.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
After all, he had helped Deane out of a pretty
awkward situation, even if he hadn’t actually saved
the chap’s life, as the silly ass insisted he had, and it
was only natural that Deane should have wanted to
show some gratitude. And the beggar had kept pretty
steady, too, with that car bearing down on him like
a—a Jug—a Jug—</p>

<p>“Say, Walt, what’s that thing the Indian guys used
to haul around so’s folks could throw themselves under
the wheels? You know; Jug o’ nuts, or something.”</p>

<p>“Juggernaut? That what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Juggernaut. I couldn’t think of it. Throw
me the football section, will you?”</p>

<small>TOM IS BORED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Clif didn’t include his part in the action when
telling Tom of the automobile accident. He
had merely encountered Loring Deane in the
village and returned to the school with him. Tom was
inclined to be hurt because Clif hadn’t asked him to
go to the village, too. “Best accident of the season,
and I miss it,” he mourned, returning from church.
“Just my luck!” After dinner he suggested a walk,
but when Clif explained that he had borrowed Deane’s
paper, and must return it to him soon, he consented
to sit on the steps in the sunshine, and peruse the comic
section while Clif dug into the football news. It was
after half-past three when the latter had exhausted the
paper and, folding it neatly, declared his intention of
restoring it to its owner. But when he bade Tom
go with him, Tom refused.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait here,” said Tom. “I’m not feeling up to
meeting your swell friends just now.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t just shove the paper at him and run,”
protested Clif. “I’ll have to stay a few minutes, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>Clif couldn’t explain satisfactorily without revealing
the details of the morning’s incident, and so he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
just said: “Gee, a fellow’s got to be polite, Tom! I
borrowed his paper, didn’t I? Oh, come on with me,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head stubbornly. “Nothing doing.
Stay as long as you like. I’ll take a little walk. See
you later, maybe.”</p>

<p>“I’d do as much for you.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have to. I’m not trying to break into
the millionaire class.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder! You make me tired! Where’ll I
find you in half an hour?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be around,” answered Tom vaguely. “Maybe
in the village. Or over at the golf course.”</p>

<p>“Or up in the attic or down cellar,” added Clif
sarcastically. “All right. See you at supper, anyway.”</p>

<p>He knew very well that Tom was slightly jealous,
but it couldn’t be helped, and he went across to East
with the paper. Glancing back as he went up the
steps, he saw Tom meandering carelessly down the
driveway, hands in pockets, and head high. Clif
grinned as he went on along the corridor. “Silly old
ass,” he murmured affectionately.</p>

<p>Save that the ceiling was considerably higher than
in the upstairs rooms, Loring Deane’s quarters were
not different from Clif’s at first glance. There were
two beds, two chiffoniers, and the usual number and
variety of chairs. What was missing, however, were
the window-seats, for here the two big windows went
almost to the floor. Then, too, there was a wash stand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
a feature lacking in the regular bedrooms. Loring was
seated in an armchair close to one of the windows, and
for once the almost inevitable rug was missing. Clif’s
gaze fell instantly from the boy’s face to his legs.
They looked like any other fellow’s, he thought in
some surprise; and then he noticed that there was
something just a little awkward in the way the feet
were placed. Most fellows cross their legs when at
ease, but Loring’s were not crossed, and the well-polished
brown shoes rested flat on the rug rather as
though they were somehow independent of the relaxed
form in the chair. Loring saw Clif’s downward glance
and rightly interpreted the expression of interest on
the visitor’s countenance, but he only said: “Take the
easy chair, Bingham. Wattles, shove it over here,
will you? You needn’t have bothered about the paper.
Are you quite through with it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks.” Clif was resolutely keeping his eyes
away from his host. “You look pretty comfortable
here, Deane.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the room is really very nice. We could do
with a little more space, but we’re not suffering. Help
yourself to the paper, Wattles. Wattles, you see, Bingham,
is always restless until he gets the paper and
learns the football scores.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Clif looked across at the man with some
surprise. “So you’re a football bug—er—Wattles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t our game he’s interested in,” Loring
laughed. “What he wants to read is that the Stoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Pogis Hotspurs won from the Lancashire Argonauts
or the Welsh Terriers beat the Bermin’am Brindles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Clif. “Over in England, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Wattles gravely. “It’s the game
I know best, Mr. Bingham.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you like our game?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, it’s most interesting, but I don’t understand
it so very well yet. It seems just a bit confusing
to the—the layman, sir.”</p>

<p>Loring chuckled, and Clif, smiling, said: “Oh, but
you’ll soon get the hang of it, Wattles, and be cheering
your head off for us.”</p>

<p>“Very likely, sir, and I’m sure I hope you will be
successful, Mr. Bingham. I have been giving a great
deal of attention and study to the game, but—” and
here Wattles smiled reproachfully—“Mister Loring
isn’t much help, sir.”</p>

<p>Clif looked inquiringly at Loring. Loring was instantly
indignant. “Why, how you talk, Wattles!
I’ve explained and explained to you, you thankless
beggar!”</p>

<p>Wattles’s discreet smile appeared again. “Yes, Mister
Loring, you have, but recently when I asked you
why one of the young gentlemen stayed so far away
from the scrum—”</p>

<p>“Scrimmage, Wattles.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, scrimmage. Well, sir, you said he was an
extra man and wasn’t allowed to take part until one of
the others was injured, but I observed that very shortly
afterwards he tackled the young gentleman who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
running with the ball, and I knew you were just having
your joke, sir.”</p>

<p>Clif had to laugh when Loring did, although he tried
not to for fear of wounding Wattles’s feelings. “Oh,
well,” said Loring, “I was kidding you that time, Wattles,
but usually you may rely implicitly on what I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Wattles, dryly but respectfully,
“but I can’t always say when you’re spoofin’—I should
say kidding, sir!”</p>

<p>The two boys exchanged amused glances as Wattles
retired to the other side of the room with the paper.
There was a low table near Loring’s chair, and on it,
amongst other things, was a folding chess-board and
an oblong box. Clif nodded toward it. “That’s a
chess-board, isn’t it? You ought to get Tom Kemble
to give you a game. He’s rather a shark at chess.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Then you’re not? Kemble’s the fellow I see you
with so often, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Tom says I haven’t enough brains for chess.
Maybe that’s it. Anyhow, I’m absolutely punk.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to play with you some time,” said Loring.
“Wattles is getting so he can beat me now, and I don’t
care about being licked every time. It’s too monotonous.
How are you at checkers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I play a little, but I’m not much better than
at chess. I can’t get interested enough, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Football’s your one and only love, then,” smiled
Loring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I do like football, but I play baseball, too.
You’re something of a football fan yourself, I guess.
I see you around most every afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am. I like to watch. And”—Loring smiled
faint apology—“I like to imagine myself playing,
Bingham. I like to make believe that if I had a good
pair of legs I’d be a wonderful football player. It’s
rather fun sometimes, pretending.”</p>

<p>Clif refrained from looking at the other’s legs with
difficulty and stammered: “Yes, it is. And—and I
dare say you’d be pretty good, too, if you—if you
could.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” laughed Loring. “You’re a gentleman,
Bingham! I’ve said the same thing to Wattles a dozen
times and the best I’ve ever got from him was, ‘Oh,
very likely, sir.’” There was a protesting sniff from
across the room. “Anyway, Bingham, I know football,
even if I can’t play it. I’ve got about every book
that’s ever been written on it.” He nodded toward a
bookcase behind Clif and the latter turned and looked.
Loring had not exaggerated. There was nearly a shelf
of them.</p>

<p>“Gee!” muttered Clif. “I didn’t know there were
half that many in the world. I’ve never read one of
them!”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to. You get your knowledge first-hand.”</p>

<p>“Are they—interesting?” asked Clif.</p>

<p>“They are to me. I dare say it sounds conceited, but
it’s really a fact that I know more football than most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
of those fellows on the First Team. I see that by
watching them. More than half the time they do things
without knowing why. One of those chaps there”—Loring
nodded again toward the bookcase—“says that
he doesn’t want the men he is coaching to know too
much football; that he’d rather teach each one only
what he can use in playing his position. He may be
right, but I don’t think so. I don’t believe a thorough
knowledge of the game is going to hurt any player.
Of course the best way to get that knowledge is by
experience, by starting as a little chap and learning as
you go along; but lots of fellows never learn more
than enough to hold down their positions by the skin
of their teeth. If I was a coach I’d make my men read
and study one of those books until they really knew
what it was all about!”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s an idea,” said Clif.</p>

<p>Loring laughed. “I can tell by the way you say that
that you think I’m a perfect nut, Bingham. It does
sound cheeky for a chap who can’t take a step without
being held up to tell a real player—”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking anything of the sort,” protested
Clif warmly. “I think it’s rather wonderful you’re so—so
clever about it. I should think not being able to
play would sort of—sort of sour you on football. I
say, why don’t you coach one of the class teams?
Couldn’t you do it?”</p>

<p>“From a wheel chair? I’m afraid not. Anyhow, I
dare say my knowledge of football isn’t more than half
practical. It’s just ‘book learning,’ Bingham. I get a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
good deal of fun out of it, though.” Loring chuckled.
“I’m an absolute nut about plays. Making them up, I
mean. I’ve got—” He broke off to address Wattles.
“Get me that portfolio, will you, Wattles? The one
with the football diagrams in it. That’s it. Thanks.
Have a look, Bingham. There’s where a lot of my
time has gone. If you laugh I’ll throw the chessmen
at you!”</p>

<p>The portfolio was slightly larger than the sheet after
sheet of letter-size bond paper inside and was closed
with three knotted tapes. Each sheet held a diagram,
sometimes two, and accompanying text, and Clif, turning
over one after another, marveled at the neatness of
the penned figures and lines and letters. Loring had
used two colors of India ink in each case, showing the
attacking team in black circles and the defending side
in red. Straight lines were straight and curved lines
were firm and graceful. The letters and figures were
remarkable, and for a moment Clif thought that Loring
was hoaxing him, that he was looking at printed diagrams.
“Tandem Outside Guard,” he read. “Forward-Pass
from Reverse Play (8),” “Forward-Pass
from End Run Threat,” “Delayed Pass from Kick
Formation.”</p>

<p>Clif looked across at Loring admiringly.</p>

<p>“Say, but these are corking! Do you think—I
mean—”</p>

<p>“Will they go? Yes, I know they will. Of course
a lot of them aren’t new. I mean by that, Bingham,
they were new to me when I doped them out, but of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
course other fellows had thought of the same thing,
or something like it. You can’t invent a new football
play very often; a radically new one, I mean. The best
you can do is work out some better way of making
an old one. Now and then, though, they change the
rules a bit and you get a new line of thought. This
year the forward-pass offers a chap the best chance
for hitting on new stuff. There’s one play there—just
let me see it a minute, will you? Yes, here it is. I’d
like to see that tried some time. It’s a fake run around
the short side with the ball going from fullback to end,
who has come around behind, and then on a forward-pass
over the long side to the other end. And here’s
another one that I really think could be worked nicely
under the proper conditions.”</p>

<p>Clif had pulled his chair beside Loring’s. His praise
of the diagrams had been genuine, but his admiration
was rather for the skill shown in their drawing than
for their practical value, for the science of football
strategy had never engaged his interest. Loring
turned the sheets forward until he came to the one
he sought. “Now, this, you see, is a scoring play,
pure and simple. It depends first of all on a quarterback
who can carry the ball and is fast.”</p>

<p>Clif nodded, leaning over to stare fascinatedly at the
red and black circles and squares, the straight lines and
curved lines and dotted lines, the letters and figures
and arrow-heads. He was beginning at last to translate
the symbols into panting, crouching players and follow
in imagination the flight of the ball along its wavy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
path. “It’s a quarterback run, isn’t it?” he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Loring. “But the ‘kick’ in this play,
Bingham, depends on keeping the ball hidden. Now,
say we’re on the fifteen-yard line—”</p>

<p>In the village at that moment Tom emerged from
Burger’s drug store after his second glass of orange-squiz.
He hadn’t particularly wanted that second drink.
He hadn’t, for that matter, particularly wanted the
first, but a fellow had to do something. He looked
again along the almost empty sidewalk in the direction
of the school, but Clif still failed to materialize. Tom
scowled, dug his hands deeper into the pockets of his
trousers, rattled some loose silver and pennies and
turned for the fourth time to a bored survey of the left-hand
window. Six dozen wrapped bottles of “Buckingham’s
Liquid Elixir, the Century’s Greatest Scientific
Discovery” made a pinkly geometrical display
in the background, while in the foreground numerous
boxes, alternately covered and uncovered, of “Tannebaum’s
Oil of Amber Soap” added a harmonizing tone
of pale yellow. Tom scowled harder than ever and
turned toward the more varied offer of the second
window. But even this soon palled on fourth acquaintance,
and finally he gave it up and set his steps
toward school, murmuring a dejected “Heck!” as he
set forth.</p>

<small>DEFEAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Monday was an easy day for both First
Team and Scrub, but on Tuesday the hard
grind began again. “Cocky” never let a
session go by without trotting his squad over to the
tackling dummy, and Clif, for one, had grown to hate
that limp and headless object with an almost passionate
intensity. Perhaps this was largely because his tackling
was not of the best and didn’t seem to improve with
practice. Mr. Babcock frequently told him that he
would never become a really good end until he could
make his tackles surer. Secretly, though, Clif considered
that he did as well as Jeff Adams, who had
asserted his right to the left end position, and a heap
better than a lot of the others. He wished he might
convince Mr. Babcock of it!</p>

<p>The field was a busy place now, for the third gridiron
was in use by the class teams, and from around
the corner of East Hall floated frantic shouts and commanding
bellows and the thud of booted balls. Practice
over there was intensive, for, since there were four
squads and but one gridiron, they worked two teams
at a time, limiting that time to an hour.</p>

<p>On Monday the Scrub was enlarged by the addition
of Joe Craigie, a guard candidate released by Coach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Otis. The First was getting its stride now, and most
of the positions were settled on. The impression that
this was to be another winning year was gaining ground
daily, for the team was ahead of the season in development
and coming steadily. Mr. Otis, switching from
last year tactics, was building his attack around Fargo.
Last season, playing very modern football indeed,
Wyndham had been beaten; although the defeat was
attributable to the renowned Grosfawk rather than
to Wyndham’s offense. A coach must build his game
about his material, and “G. G.’s” principal assets this
year were a powerful fullback who was seldom stopped
without some gain and a flashy halfback, Jensen, who
had a positive genius for finding fissures in the enemy
line and making chasms of them. So, while the passing
and running games were not neglected, it was the
old, reliable line-bucking style of play that the Head
Coach was teaching the First. And this meant that
the Scrub had to stand some tough onslaughts those
days. It was lucky for the Second that its line held
such weighty, non-breakable veterans as Clem Henning
and “Babe” and “Wink” and Al Greene and Jimmy
Ames, for a lighter or less experienced lot of forwards
would never have stood the strain. When “Big Bill”
Fargo smashed in, you knew without being told or
reading about it that something had happened!</p>

<p>Mr. Otis had sought to provide a strong, heavy
line, sacrificing something of speed in the effort, and
Raiford and Higgs and Quinlan, early season probabilities,
had been put aside in favor of sturdier men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Billy Desmond seemed sure of right guard position,
Carlson was in center in place of Higgs, and Weldon
had ousted Raiford at right tackle. It was only at
the end positions that “G. G.” placed speed above brawn,
and Archer and Drayton were first choices there.
Stoddard still had a perceptible edge on Houston at
quarter, while Whitemill and Sproule were fighting for
left half back’s place.</p>

<p>On Thursday the Scrub was instructed to use one
forward-pass in every three plays in order that the
First might work up a better defense before meeting
Horner Academy on Saturday. Clif, who had shown
fair ability as a receiver of thrown balls, came through
with only an ensanguined nose, a strained wrist and
a few minor abrasions, and considered himself lucky.
He accused Tom of trying to kill him off by putting
him into almost every forward-pass, but he was really
very much tickled. One of the passes gave Clif a
seventeen-yard run and led to the only score made by
the Scrub that week. But most of the attempts to gain
by the aerial route failed, for Coach Otis had worked
out a very satisfactory defense and it was difficult for
Tom and Sim to find an eligible and uncovered man to
throw to. Although the Scrub was given the ball many
times when she hadn’t earned it, the First held it some
of the time and didn’t have very much trouble in making
two touchdowns and a like number of field-goals.
Friday saw another hard session and then, on Saturday,
Nemesis in the shape of some twenty-five husky
youths with blue-and-brown-striped stockings came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
along and upset calculations horribly. Horner came
from a long way off, but a hard railway journey had
not hurt them a bit, it seemed.</p>

<p>Wyndham scored first, in the second quarter, when,
held firmly on Horner’s nineteen yards, Stoddard
kicked a goal from the twenty-eight. But that was
the last of such performances, for after that the game
was all Horner. The Blue-and-Brown took the ball
on its forty-two when the third quarter arrived and
rushed it straight down to Wyndham’s twenty-six,
using off-tackle and round the end plays varied with
one forward-pass that was good for eight yards.
Wyndham held for two downs and then succumbed
before a tricky play that should have been either a kick
or a pass and was a quick quarterback plunge at center
that landed the ball just short of the required distance.
A wedge on the left of the dark blue line made it first
down, and from the fifteen Horner took the ball over
in six plays, battering at Desmond and Weldon until
the right of the Wyndham line finally crumpled and
the last charge yielded four long yards and a touchdown.</p>

<p>“G. G.” replaced Desmond with Smythe and, still
later, sent half a dozen other substitutes dribbling in.
But Horner couldn’t be seriously dented between
tackles, and although, as a final desperate enterprise,
“G. G.” sent Sproule in for Whitemill with instructions
to round the ends, Wyndham came no nearer another
score than the enemy’s thirty-two yards, from
where, well along in the fourth quarter, “Big Bill”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
made a desperate and well-nigh hopeless try for a goal
from placement. The ball came down near the five-yard
line. Horner was still not through, and in the
last six minutes of the twelve-minute period, she added
insult to injury by plowing her way from midfield,
where she had taken a short punt, to the seventeen
yards and, when stubbornly held there, shooting a forward
toss over the middle of the line for another
score. As a doughty fullback kicked an easy goal
after each touchdown the final humiliating score was
14 to 3.</p>

<p>Well, a team can’t always win, and Wyndham had
feared Horner beforehand. Unfortunately, though,
she hadn’t feared her enough. Wyndham’s defense
against the forward-pass, which had worked nicely
when opposed to her Scrub, had failed badly. Horner
had tried the air three times and each time had succeeded.
Her style of passing was, however, different
from the Scrub’s, and the First had failed to solve it.
Evidently, then, there was still much to be learned as
to protection against the passing game. Even Coach
Otis’s big line of forwards hadn’t gained much glory.
More than one Horner plunge had torn it wide apart,
while the enemy’s persistent attack on Desmond and
Weldon had shown conclusively that the right side
needed something at present lacking. Wyndham’s ends
had been boxed time after time, and even “Big Bill,”
the pride and boast of the School, had fallen down
badly on the defense. Altogether, then, the coaches
had much to ruminate on that Saturday evening. Especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
as Horner Academy then rated about 60 to
Wolcott’s 100!</p>

<p>But other things besides football games and practicings
occurred during that week preceding Wyndham’s
first defeat. For instance, there was a stupendous
chess combat between Loring and Tom. That
took place on Wednesday evening. Clif had almost
despaired of inducing Tom to visit Loring. Tom
was studiedly indifferent on Sunday and Monday,
agreeing with his chum that it was extremely likely
that Loring Deane could beat him at chess. Tom stated
humbly that he really wasn’t much of a player. Clif
contradicted the assertion indignantly, almost spoiling
his conspiracy by declaring that maybe Tom could lick
Loring after all. On Tuesday, having recovered from
an attack of jealousy, Tom said that a fellow who
didn’t have much else to do but play chess ought to be
pretty good at it. On Wednesday he capitulated and
followed Clif over to East Hall when supper was
over. No one could well help being attracted to
Loring, and Tom forgot his prejudice instantly. Soon
they were seated with the chess-board between them
and the game was on. Clif watched, at first with interest,
then, as time passed, merely for want of other
occupation. Wattles was not present. After serving
Loring’s supper—Loring had all his meals in his room—he
was free until half-past nine, at which time he returned
to get the boy to bed. Sometimes Wattles
went to the village and attended the moving pictures,
but more frequently he was to be found in the library<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
or reading room in West Hall. Clif wished he were
present. Talking to Wattles would be far more amusing
than watching the interminable game.</p>

<p>When, finally, Loring won, Clif got the impression
that the host would have preferred to lose. Loring
was almost apologetic and found numerous excuses for
Tom. Tom, however, was a good loser, and he refused
to take refuge behind the excuses. “Heck,” he
said, “you just played better chess, Deane. Where
I made my mistake—”</p>

<p>And then they played the whole thing all over again,
and had scarcely more than finished when the gong
warned of study hour!</p>

<p>The next evening Tom hurried through his supper
and was almost impatient with Clif because the latter,
in spite of many honorable wounds received in battle
that afternoon, was hungry and insisted on satisfying
his appetite. When they got to Loring’s room that
youth was still eating, and Tom had to wait a good
ten minutes while Loring finished and Wattles removed
the tray and the small table was placed close to Loring’s
chair. Then another battle began, and Clif selected
one of the books on football and fairly turned his back
on the game. This time, though, the contest was soon
over, for Loring made a fatal mistake soon after the
start. As there was scarcely time for another, the
chessmen were put away, Clif returned the book he had
been reading to the shelf and they talked. Presently
Tom asked to see the collection of football diagrams
of which Clif had told him and the rest of the time was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
spent in discussing them. Tom was loud in his praise
of them, but he thought some of them not workable,
and that led to a three-cornered discussion during which
the chess-board was again produced and several plays
were rehearsed. Tom proved his contention with regard
to one of them and Loring cheerfully crumpled
a sheet of paper up and tossed it into the waste-basket.
Going back to West, Tom confided to his companion
that Loring Deane knew a lot of football and that it
was a plaguey shame he couldn’t get out and play like
other fellows.</p>

<p>By the last of that week going over to Loring’s after
supper had become a habit with Clif and Tom, and by
Saturday evening the intimacy had reached the point
where the chums were calling Loring by his first name
and Loring was saying “Tom” and “Clif” quite naturally.
Discussion of the First Team’s defeat by
Horner delayed the chess game that evening, to Clif’s
delight, and the subject was well thrashed out between
them before the board was set out on the little table.
In an argument between Tom and Loring on the subject
of Stoddard’s choice of plays, Loring, in Clif’s
opinion, won conclusively.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he made mistakes,” Tom conceded at
last, “but he’s better than Houston, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” answered Loring, “but neither of them
is my idea of a corking quarter. But then, I’m not
keen on their style, anyway.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, Loring?” Clif asked.</p>

<p>“I mean that if I were a football coach I wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
ask my quarterback to carry the ball much. Football’s
a lot like war, Clif. The coach is the commander-in-chief
who lays out the plan of the battle. The
quarterback is the general who carries out his orders.
But the coach can’t plan in detail because there’s no
way to know beforehand what situations will arise.
That’s where the quarter is called on for generalship.
There’s no chance to confer with the coach. He’s got
to size up each situation as it arrives and decide what
to do. It’s up to him to move his forces so as to win.
I’ve never played quarterback, but I think I know
pretty well what a quarter’s up against. He’s got to
consider a lot of things, such as the situation of the
ball in regard to the goals and the side lines, the number
of the down, the distance to be gained, the strength
and weakness of the enemy, the ability and condition
of his backs, a dozen more things. And he’s got to
reach a decision in mighty short time usually. Well,
now I think all that’s quite enough to saddle one fellow
with when his side is on the offensive. He’s got enough
to do without being called on to carry the ball, and if
he was my quarter he wouldn’t be asked to get into
the interference too often. If he could run the team
I wouldn’t care whether he ever gained a foot of ground
himself. Just knowing what plays to call and calling
them correctly and keeping his team fighting every
minute—why, I’d forgive him even if he wasn’t a wonder
on defense. He could fumble a punt now and then
and I’d still call him a corking quarter!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” said Tom. “Still, lots of fellows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
can run the team and carry the ball, too. Some of the
finest quarterbacks have been all-around men.”</p>

<p>“I know, but they aren’t so numerous, Tom. The
average fellow, especially if he is prep school age, can’t
do a lot of things at once and do them all well. Any
quarter, I don’t care who he is, will be of more value
to his team if he just has to run it and isn’t expected
to carry the ball himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Tom doubtfully. “If
he’s a cracker-jack runner and hard to stop—”</p>

<p>“Make him a halfback then and find another quarter,”
said Loring.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he might have ability to run the team,
too,” objected Tom. “No, I don’t believe I agree with
you, Loring. I’ve seen some mighty good quarters
who could do both things.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying there haven’t been some or won’t
be more,” replied Loring pleasantly. “But they’re the
exceptions. A fellow only has one brain and it will
hold only so much. When he tries to get too much into
it he crowds it. If he has too much on his mind he’s
bound to trip up now and then, and now and then is
far too often. To-day Stoddard wouldn’t have made
three or four glaring mistakes in judgment if he’d had
only the running of the team to think about. I’ve
never played the game, Tom, but you can’t make me
believe that a fellow, the average fellow, anyhow, can
take the ball, run thirty yards with it, dodging three
or four tacklers, be thrown hard and sat on and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
get up with a clear head and know almost instantly what
the next play ought to be!”</p>

<p>“He surely can’t,” agreed Clif. “I think you’re dead
right, Loring.”</p>

<p>“Heck, might as well let the quarter sit on the bench
alongside the coach, then,” grumbled Tom. “Nothing
to do but call his signals!”</p>

<p>“Why not do away with the quarter entirely?” asked
Loring, laughing. “Let the coach run the team from
the side-line by radio!”</p>

<p>“Fine,” applauded Clif. “Then, if he lost his game,
he could blame it on static!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got a quarter who knows both branches
of his trade pretty well,” said Clif. “Sim’s a mighty
fine player, I think.”</p>

<p>“That’s Jackson?” asked Loring. “He’s the dark-haired
chap, isn’t he? Well, have you ever noticed
how seldom he takes the ball himself?”</p>

<p>Tom blinked. “I guess we haven’t got many plays
for quarterback,” he answered. Then he caught an
amused twinkle in Loring’s eyes. “Oh, come on and
let’s play,” he laughed.</p>

<small>THE CONSULTING COACH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Clif’s father was to have visited him Sunday,
but the morning brought a telegram stating
that a sudden journey to Boston necessitated
a postponement of the Freeburg trip to the following
Sunday. Clif’s disappointment was not lasting. In
the afternoon he and Tom and Loring went for a walk.
That is, he and Tom walked and took turns pushing
Loring’s chair, long since mended by the local carpenter.
Wattles was left behind, delighted by the
prospect of two hours of browsing in the school library
but uneasy at intrusting his charge to the two boys.</p>

<p>The day was fair and, for the latter part of October
in that region, quite warm. Along Oak Street many
of the residents were on their porches, and the sight
of the boy in the wheel chair created much interest
and curiosity. Clif was conscious of the craning necks
and low-voiced comments, but Loring seemed not to
be aware of them. Perhaps, Clif thought, you got used
to that sort of thing after a while. They went through
the village and then westward and came to a halt at
last beside the little river where the end of the old
covered bridge offered a sheltered, sunny nook. Clif
and Tom climbed to the top of a fence. Loring, supplied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
with a willow wand at his request, trimmed it
with his knife and whittled contentedly while conversation
roamed from one subject to another. They
were on a little-traveled road and the only vehicle to
rattle across the bridge during their sojourn was an
old buggy drawn by a fat gray horse and occupied by
a roly-poly old man who gave them a cheerful “Afternoon,
boys,” and painstakingly forbore to stare at
Loring. Loring’s gaze followed the retreating figure
and he smiled.</p>

<p>“He wanted so much to take a good look, too,” said
Loring. “Nice old codger. I almost wanted to tell
him I didn’t mind.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re pretty used to it,” Tom mused.
“Say, how long have you been this way?”</p>

<p>Clif looked startled, but Loring only smiled as he
answered: “Sixteen years and seven months, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Six—you mean <em>always</em>?”</p>

<p>“Ever since I was born.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! Can’t they do anything? What’s it like?”</p>

<p>Clif thought the questions in rather poor taste and
looked apologetic on his friend’s behalf, but Loring
didn’t appear to mind. “They haven’t done much
yet,” he answered. “I’ve been treated by a lot of doctors,
here and abroad, but nothing much has come of
it. My leg bones don’t pick out the right food to
grow on, it seems. They’re too fond of lime. Calcification
the doctors call it. That and a lot of other
things. Usually each one has his own pet name for
it. Anyway, there’s too much chalk in those bones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
down there, and if I ever got mad with you, Tom, and
kicked you, you’d have the laugh on me because I’d
break my leg. They’re so brittle they’re no use at all
as legs. Sometimes I think it would be better to get
rid of them and save the price of shoes and stockings,
but no one else seems to. The doctor father is supporting
now makes believe I’ll be able to use the silly
things some day; says that as I get older the bone
structure will get more sense. I don’t know, though.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you do anything for it?” asked Clif.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m on a funny diet, for one thing. You’d
be surprised, fellows, to know what perfectly innocent
looking things contain lime! And this doctor’s working
on the theory that if I don’t give the bones enough
lime to suit them they’ll get discouraged and use something
else. Then poor old Wattles has to take me to
walk every morning and night.”</p>

<p>“Take you to walk!” exclaimed Tom incredulously.</p>

<p>“That’s what he calls it,” laughed Loring. “We’re
doing an eighth of a mile now twice a day; a two-twenty-yard
dash, you know! You see, they won’t
let me use my legs myself, so Wattles does it for me.
He massages the pesky things and works all the joints—as
carefully as if they were made of glass—and has
a jolly good time of it. Wattles is really a brick. He
had to put in a week or more at the hospital and take
a course of instruction before he could get the job, and
I believe he honestly thinks now that he’s an authority
on bone diseases. He’s a conscientious chap, too, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
if the house caught on fire while he was ‘exercising’
me I’ll bet he wouldn’t get out until I’d had my full
thirty minutes!”</p>

<p>“But couldn’t you use crutches?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, but they won’t let me do it. Too much chance
of an accident, they say. I’m not even allowed to cross
my legs! Not that I’m at all sure I could do it, for
it’s so long since I tried that I honestly believe I’ve
forgotten how.” He turned to smile at Clif. “That
was a pretty close call the other day, you know. I
dare say that if that car had dumped me out of the
chair Wattles would have had to sweep my legs up
into a dustpan!”</p>

<p>“What was that?” demanded Tom. “I didn’t hear
about it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Clif tell you?” asked Loring. Then he
laughed. “Sorry, Clif. I thought he knew.”</p>

<p>“He does know. That is, I told him all he needed
to know,” muttered Clif.</p>

<p>“You never did! Whatever it is, you didn’t say a
word about it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you about meeting Loring in the village
last Sunday? Well, then!”</p>

<p>“Sure, but you didn’t say anything about Loring
being dumped out of his chair!”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t dumped out of his chair. All that happened—”</p>

<p>“Better let me tell it,” said Loring.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” answered Clif. “There’s nothing to
tell, anyway. You were coming across the street—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>“Shut up!” Tom commanded sternly. “No one
wants to hear from you. Go ahead, Loring.”</p>

<p>So Loring went ahead and gave a perfectly truthful
and not at all sensational account of the affair, and
Tom viewed Clif accusingly during the narrative and,
when it was finished, exclaimed disgustedly: “Of all
the tight mouthed, secretive vipers! Loring, I’ve
watched over that guy ever since he came here. I was
the first one to befriend him. Without me, he—he
wouldn’t be anywhere to-day. And look at the way
he repays me! Goes out and makes a silly hero of
himself saving people from being trampled underfoot
by rampageous automobiles and never says a word
about it! And he calls that friendship, I suppose!”</p>

<p>“You make me tired, both of you,” grumbled Clif.
“There wasn’t much danger, anyway, and all I did
was give a yank to the chair. The fellow in the car
would have missed him even if I hadn’t touched it.
And if you go and tell this to any one else, Tom, I’ll
make you wish you hadn’t!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Tom good-naturedly. “You
might have known I wouldn’t spill it, Clif. Next time
you come right home, like a good little boy, and tell
daddy all about it.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any next time,” answered Clif emphatically.</p>

<p>“Not with me,” chuckled Loring. “Wattles will
never give me another chance to congest traffic. The
poor chap had nightmares so badly that night that I
had to wake him up twice!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a wonder he let you go without him to-day,”
marveled Clif.</p>

<p>“I was surprised myself,” agreed Loring. “I more
than half expected to find him tagging along behind,
keeping a watchful eye on me. You don’t happen to
see a black derby sticking up behind a bush anywhere,
do you?”</p>

<p>Going back, Tom, trundling the chair, broke a silence
of several minutes with: “Look here, Loring, I wish
you’d do something for me. I mean for us, for the
Scrub Team.”</p>

<p>“I will if I can. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve been looking on at practice and scrimmage
almost every day, and you know a lot about football
and how it ought to be played, and I’ve been thinking
that a fellow on the side-line sees a good deal that
gets by those on the field.”</p>

<p>“Well—”</p>

<p>“Now what I’d like you to do is this. You watch
how things go; watch the fellows play; size up the
whole performance, you know, and then you tell me
afterwards what’s wrong. Of course the Scrub’s just
the Scrub, but I’m captain of it and I’d like to see the
old outfit make a good showing. You’ve got some
pretty good ideas about the game, Loring, and I guess
if you sort of kept an eye on us and then we had a talk
afterwards, why—”</p>

<p>“That’s the most sensible remark you ever got off,”
said Clif. “I call that a corking good idea!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to try,” said Loring. “I’d like to immensely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
fellows, but, after all, my football’s just what
you might call theory, and it seems rather cheeky for a
chap who has never played a lick to—to set up as a
critic!”</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t,” answered Tom firmly. “Critics
are always like that. The good ones, I mean. I don’t
have to be a baker to know when a pie is punk! You
just watch us play, Loring, and see where we fall down.
I’m not throwing off on ‘Cocky.’ He’s a dandy coach.
But he isn’t on the outside looking in, and he’s got a
lot of stuff to think about all at once. Things might
easily get by him—little things especially—just because
he’s right on top of the play. Then there’s
strategy, too. There’s a whole lot in that, Loring,
and you’ve sort of studied that end of it. So, if it
wouldn’t be too much of a bother, I wish you’d help
us out, Loring.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will! Why, it’ll be a lot of fun for
me, Tom. Almost like playing football myself!”</p>

<p>“Done! Here, you push awhile, you lazy beggar!”</p>

<p>“Lazy yourself,” answered Clif as he took the other’s
place. “I should think, though, you’d be glad to keep
the job, Tom. It isn’t every day you get the chance
to be chauffeur to the consulting coach!”</p>

<p>After they had consigned Loring to the care of a
relieved Wattles and were returning to West, Clif
said: “How did you happen to think of that scheme,
Tom? I’ll bet he can give us some mighty good tips,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well; it can’t do us any harm, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“Any harm?”</p>

<p>Tom turned on his companion a look of mild perplexity.
“For goodness’ sake, Clif,” he replied, “you
don’t suppose I really meant all that guff!”</p>

<p>“What did you say it for, then?” asked Clif indignantly.</p>

<p>“Because,” Tom answered equably, “I wanted to
give the poor chap a little more interest in life. Didn’t
you see how pleased he was? Why, as he said, it will
be almost like playing the game himself. I like that
chap, old son, and I want to do anything I can to—to—”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do? Then why try to make a fool of him?
Don’t you suppose he will find out quick enough that
you don’t really want his advice?”</p>

<p>“No, why should he? And I haven’t said I didn’t
want his advice. Of course I want it if it’s any good.
I just don’t suppose it will be, that’s all. The big
thing is to give him a better time here, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Clif dubiously, “but, just the same,
it seems sort of mean to fool him, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I’m not fooling him until he finds it out,” replied
the other philosophically, “and he never will find it out
unless you tell him.”</p>

<p>“I’d be likely to,” jeered Clif.</p>

<p>“Exactly. So that’s that. See you at supper, old
timer.”</p>

<p>Coach Otis made several shifts in the First Team on
Monday and it was late when the Scrub was called over.
During one fifteen-minute session the First scored two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
touchdowns, Whitemill making the first on a long run
from midfield and Fargo going over for the second
from the Scrub’s seven-yards. Tom’s team was on
the defensive most of the time and, if truth must be
told, played rather raggedly. On the First, Billy Desmond
was displaced by Quinlan, and Couch and
Williams held the ends. The First, nettled by Saturday’s
defeat, played savage ball. Jimmy Ames, in
tackling Jensen soon after the trouble started, sustained
a bad wrench of his left knee and was out for
the day and for many more days to follow. Clem
Henning retired early, too, after some zealous First
Team man had put his knee into him, but Clem’s injury
was only temporary. On the whole, the Scrub
got pretty well battered up during that brief session,
and minor injuries were numerous.</p>

<p>That afternoon Loring watched the Scrub during its
practice and then followed it across to the First Team
field, and after supper, when Clif and Tom dropped in
on him he was well primed with criticism. But the
faults Loring had discovered were already known to
coach and captain, and while Tom treated Loring’s
disclosures with the utmost respect Clif knew quite
well that he was not taking them seriously. Loring
pointed out that several of the Scrub linemen were slow
in starting, that “Wink” Coles played too high, that
Stiles had a bad habit of slowing up before reaching
the line and that Clif Bingham had missed two tackles!
Loring also criticized Jackson for attempting a forward-pass
on fourth down on his own thirty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
yards, which attempt resulted in an interception by
the First and brought about the latter’s second touchdown.
Tom declared that he was glad to get the tips
and that he would pass them on to “Cocky.”</p>

<p>“Of course some of it won’t be news to him, though.
He’s been trying to speed up the forwards right along,
for instance; and that stuff about Clif is old, too. He
does miss too many tackles, and that’s no joke.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why, either,” Clif complained. “I try
hard enough.”</p>

<p>“I thought to-day that you tried <em>too</em> hard,” said
Loring. “That time you tried for Whitemill, Clif,
you weren’t near enough when you grabbed, and you
got only one hand on him. It’s possible that you’re
too anxious, isn’t it? Hadn’t you better try getting
closer to your man before tackling?”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s it,” said Clif, glumly. “There’s
something wrong. ‘Cocky’ has told me all along that
I’m a punk tackler, and I guess I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re not as bad as that,” said Tom. “There
are others!”</p>

<p>“Of course I didn’t think that I was telling you
news,” said Loring. “You asked me to tell you what
I saw, Tom, and that’s what I’ve done. I still say that
it’s cheeky of me to set up as a football authority and
critic, you know!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it,” Tom answered. “You certainly got
the dope on us to-day, didn’t you? You keep up the
good work, old son. Unless we do a heap better than
we did to-day we’re going to need all the help we can
get!”</p>

<small>THE FIGHTING SCRUB</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Tuesday found the Fighting Scrub putting
up a better defense, even though McMurtry,
in Ames’s place, proved a weak point in the
line. Later Joe Craigie, a substitute guard, ousted
McMurtry and the left side of the Scrub line got back
to normal. In the first period of the practice game
“Big Bill” banged through for a touchdown and Stoddard
kicked the goal, while the best the Scrub could do
was repeatedly kick out of danger. In the second go,
however, with Fargo out of it and “Swede” Hanbury
in his position, the Scrub not only held the enemy scoreless
but earned two points when Houston, at quarter,
touched the ball down for a safety rather than have a
touchdown scored. The Scrub put up a hard
fight toward the end and Captain Tom had the ball
on the adversary’s twelve yards when the whistle
blew.</p>

<p>On Wednesday it became known that Quinlan, of
the First, was in trouble at the Office and might not
get reinstated in time to do much more playing. Quinlan
was only a second-string guard, but he was a good
man and his loss was no light matter. “G. G.” reached
out and grabbed Clem Henning away from the Scrub,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
and the wails of that aggregation were loud and heart-rending.
As Tom pointed out, and as most of the
others acknowledged, it was luck for Clem, and for his
sake they were glad enough, but his loss left a gaping
hole in the Scrub line that Joe Craigie couldn’t wholly
fill. After two days of experimenting, Coach Babcock
put Joe back at left tackle and gave the right guard
position to Howlett. Howlett was light, but he had
plenty of fight, and in time he learned his duties very
well. But during the rest of that week the disrupted
Scrub took some fine wallopings from the First and
got but one score. That single bit of glory belonged
about evenly to Clif and Johnny Thayer. It was Clif
who pulled down Jackson’s long heave across the left
of the line and ran it through a thickly populated alien
territory to the four yards where he was tackled from
behind by Duval. If Clif was still weak at making
tackles he was certainly strong at avoiding them, for
no fewer than four of the First at one time or another
laid hands on him. Clif had a way of spinning out of
delaying clutches that was very pretty indeed! From
the four yards, Johnny Thayer, at fullback, took
the ball across in one straight plunge on Cotter.
Sim Jackson fumbled the pass and there was no
goal.</p>

<p>Clif and Johnny were metaphorically presented with
the Key of the City by their grateful team mates on
Friday night. That score had been sorely needed to
prop up the Scrub’s declining self-respect, and so those
who had provided it were momentary heroes. Tom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
didn’t stop lavishing praise on Clif all the evening, and
he was ably abetted by Loring. Tom was inclined to
lose track of the fact that the First Team was in all
ways a superior organization and to lay every detail
to the Scrub’s shortcomings rather than to the adversary’s
fuller knowledge and better playing. It was hard
to make him see why the Scrub didn’t have an even
chance at every game. Tom was making a very good
captain, although, as frequently happens, being captain
had slowed up his progress as a player. Not that Tom
wasn’t still holding down the left halfback position in
good shape, for he was. He was a more certain gainer
through the line than Lou Stiles, was a better punter
than any one on the First except “Big Bill” Fargo
and could get a forward-pass off in fine style. It was
just that his anxiety to have the Scrub a great team
caused him to give more thought to its development
than to the individual duties of Tom Kemble, with the
result that Tom’s progress was not quite keeping up
with that of the others. Tom was far from realizing
this, although Mr. Babcock, who played no favorites,
was after Tom a good deal during practice. Doubtless
if Tom hadn’t had so many things on his mind it
would have dawned on him that his playing wasn’t
meeting with “Cocky’s” entire approval.</p>

<p>Clif encountered Wattles in the corridor on his way
back from supper that Wednesday evening. Wattles
was carrying Loring’s tray to the dining room. Clif
said, “Hello, Wattles,” and would have passed, but
Wattles would have speech with him. “Mister Bingham,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
said Wattles earnestly, “may I take the liberty
of complimenting you, sir, on that remarkable run you
made this afternoon? Really, sir, it was a most stirring
performance!”</p>

<p>“Think so, Wattles?” laughed Clif. “Well, you’re
likely to see much better stuff than that if you stick
around.”</p>

<p>Wattles shook his head, apparently incredulous. “It
doesn’t seem possible, sir. The way you evaded those
young gentlemen of the opposing side was wonderful.
What I call a most clever performance, sir, a really
bang-up bit of playing, sir!”</p>

<p>“Why, thanks, Wattles, that’s very nice of you.
Getting to like our style of football better, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to understand it, Mr. Bingham, and
I don’t hesitate to say that, barring what looks
to me like too heavy a stress on what I may call the
slugging features, it is a more exciting game than we
play, sir.”</p>

<p>“But look here, Wattles, we don’t slug!”</p>

<p>“No, sir? Oh, very possibly, very possibly. What
I alluded to is the part where you face each other, Mr.
Bingham, and then—er—mix it up! But perhaps Mister
Loring has misled me. I understood from him
that using the fists was permissible, quite the usual
thing. I have the wrong—er—dope, sir?”</p>

<p>“You certainly have, Wattles!” Clif laughed. “Loring’s
been ‘having’ you, as you’d say!”</p>

<p>“Very likely, sir,” sighed Wattles. “Thank you.”</p>

<p>Cupples Institute, Wyndham’s opponent the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
afternoon, had been defeated by Wolcott a fortnight
before, 19 to 7. To those who delighted in comparative
scores to-day’s contest was of much interest. The
Dark Blue was expected to win, but by a close score,
and whether that score would better 19 to 7 was problematical.
However, Cupples didn’t show as strong
as expected. Wyndham outpunted her all through the
game and outrushed her during two periods. Fargo
went over for Wyndham’s first score four minutes
after the kick-off and Stoddard kicked goal. Again,
in the second, Fargo added another touchdown, and
again Stoddard did his part. The half ended: Wyndham
14, Cupples 0.</p>

<p>With Ogden replacing Jensen and two second-string
men relieving Fargo by turns in the fourth period, the
Dark Blue was less assertive. There were two long
runs and some decent gains through the Cupples line
around midfield, but the best Wyndham could do in
either of the remaining quarters was to add two field-goals
to her score.</p>

<p>Wyndham was highly pleased with the result of that
afternoon’s performance since, any way you looked at
it, 20 to 0 was eight points better than Wolcott’s score
of 19 to 7. There was also a pleasant conviction that,
had she wanted to, Wyndham could have done even
better. The only fly in the ointment came to light the
next day when a perusal of the morning papers revealed
the fact that Wolcott had defeated Toll’s Academy
26 to 9.</p>

<p>Toll’s was Wyndham’s next opponent, and had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
counted on to give the Dark Blue a lot of trouble. The
New York team had gone through five contests without
having her goal-line crossed and it had been expected
that she would hold Wolcott to a very meager score.
Indeed, there were plenty at Wyndham who had, no
later than yesterday, predicted for Wolcott nothing
better than a tie game. Tom refused to believe his
own paper and was only convinced of the correctness
of the score when Clif’s journal told the same story.
In the light of that result it was necessary to either
revise their former opinion of Toll’s or to credit Wolcott
with being about fifty per cent better than they
had considered her. Tom’s well-known capacity for
pessimism helped him make out a very good case in
favor of the latter alternative.</p>

<p>“If Wolcott can make four touchdowns on Toll’s
she can trim us, Clif,” he declared gloomily.</p>

<p>“But she didn’t. She made three touchdowns and
a field-goal. Can’t you read?”</p>

<p>“Well, three, then. It makes no difference. Say,
I’ll bet Toll’s will hand us an awful wallop next Saturday!”</p>

<p>“How do you get that way?” asked Clif indignantly.
“If we aren’t as good as Wolcott this minute I’ll—I’ll
treat! Look at yesterday’s game.”</p>

<p>“Sure, but we’re playing Toll’s on her own field,
and you know that makes a big difference. Wolcott
played her at home, with all the cheering her own way.
Say, it doesn’t say a word about that boy wonder of
theirs, Goshawk, or whatever his name is. According<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
to this, he didn’t score a point. He was in the
line-up, though; played right end.”</p>

<p>“Probably Wolcott didn’t pull many forward-passes,”
said Clif. “Guess she didn’t have to. Maybe
she thought we’d have some scouts there. Say, I wonder
why ‘G. G.’ didn’t go over, or send some one.”</p>

<p>“Next week,” answered Tom. “He’d rather get his
dope fresh. That’s what I heard, anyway.”</p>

<p>After church Clif’s father appeared in the blue car
and there was another gorgeous feed at the Inn. This
time Tom was the only guest, for Walter was taking
dinner with friends in the village. The weather was
not at all kind, and the ride in the afternoon was short,
and Mr. Bingham’s brief visit came to an end well
before darkness had set in. When he said good-by
and was speeding off down the drive, the red tail-light
gleaming between the trees, Clif had a momentary
qualm of something very like homesickness. But it
didn’t survive the journey up to Number 34, where
Tom and Billy Desmond, the latter stretched luxuriously
between the protuberances of his beloved couch,
were wrangling joyously over the relative merits of
the Princeton and Yale teams. Besides, Clif recalled,
his father had promised faithfully to come up for the
Wolcott game, and that was but three weeks away.
He was to make an early start from Providence on
Saturday morning, get to Freeburg by noon and then
take Clif and Tom and probably a couple of other
fellows over to Cotterville in time for the big event.
Clif got over his brief depression as he reached Number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
34, and, throwing himself on Tom’s bed, remarked
maliciously that, as for Yale or Princeton, there was
only one real football team doing business that fall.
“Listen, you two. Cornell could lick either of them
without getting really warmed up well!”</p>

<p>Forgetting their previous differences, Tom and Billy
united in a common cause and spent the succeeding ten
minutes telling Clif what an ignoramus he was.</p>

<p>On Monday, facing a patched-up First Team, the
Fighting Scrub dug its claws deep and gouged and
tore its way to a one-score victory. There was no
luck about it, either. It was no fluke win. Scrub just
took the ball away from a somewhat dreamy First
near midfield and hammered and thrust its way to the
six yards. Johnny Thayer sustained facial abrasions
that made him look like an utter stranger to his companions,
Lou Stiles delayed proceedings while they
pumped air back into him, and Tom walked with a pronounced
limp for the rest of the day, but between them
they landed the ball on the six yards. Coach Otis, pursuing
his charges with stinging comments and much
excellent advice, wore a somewhat dazed expression
by then. Sportingly, however, he refrained from
strengthening his team with even one of the eager aspirants
who dragged their blankets along the side-line.</p>

<p>“Watch the ball, First!” he snapped. “Hold them
now! Higgs, get down, man! Close up there,
Smythe, and stop this play! Throw them back, First!”</p>

<p>“Let’s have it!” shouted Sim hoarsely. “Smear ’em,
Scrub! Let’s have this score!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“Get into it, Scrub! Fight!” panted Tom. “Smash
’em up! You can do it! Show ’em who you are!
Come on, you Fighting Scrub!”</p>

<p>“Third down,” called Manager Macon, refereeing,
“and about four to go!” Then he blew his whistle.</p>

<p>The lines swayed, First thrust forward desperately,
Sim, doubled over the ball, turned his back to the
mêlée as Tom plunged past. Then Johnny Thayer
reached for the pigskin, wrapped his long arms about
it and crashed into the faltering Tom. Confusion,
grunts, smothered words, the grinding and rasping of
canvas against canvas, and then a sudden forward
movement of the right of the line that as suddenly
stopped and the shrill blast of the whistle. Macon
dived into the pile and the confusion became order.</p>

<p>“Not over! About a foot to go, Scrub! Fourth
down!”</p>

<p>The Scrub yelled its triumph, the First snarled back,
the coaches hurled commands and Sim gave his signals
again. What had yielded eleven feet was surely good
for one, and Johnny, leading the tandem, the ball tightly
hugged, dashed again at the same point and, as he
struck the line, thrust the trampled turf away from him
and went up and forward over the shoulders of the
enemy and, ere the tide set backward, held the ball for
an instant well past the last white streak!</p>

<p>First trotted, walked or limped back to the gymnasium
a few minutes later with, for the time, nothing
further to ask of life. Tom, smiting Johnny between
his broad shoulders, asked solicitously yet joyously:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
“How’re you feeling, old son?” And Johnny, grinning
painfully with swollen lips, croaked: “Like a two-year-old,
Tom! Say, didn’t we give ’em fits?”</p>

<p>“Fits? We trampled on ’em, Johnny, we trampled
on ’em! The Fighting Scrub, that’s us, boy!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<small>TOM’S LUCK TURNS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The discouraging thing about beating the First
was that the First wouldn’t stay beaten. If
you scored on it one day it came back the
following day and tried to see just how overbearing it
could be. Or if you beat it on Monday, say, it spent
the rest of the week rubbing your face in the dirt, until
you almost wished you hadn’t been so rash. So the
Scrub’s hour of triumph was brief. On Tuesday the
enemy, with all its best talent present, took a long, craving
look at the Scrub and proceeded to devour it. Three
scores, two touchdowns and a field-goal resulted from
the first period, by the end of which the Scrub was
somewhat demoralized although still fighting. During
the five minutes of intermission Mr. Babcock managed
to restore his charges to a fair condition of usefulness.
What no one could understand was why, when
the Scrub had the ball, the First got the jump every
time and upset every play before it reached the line.
This had happened with such monotony that the most
reasonable explanation seemed to be that the First had
somehow since yesterday become endowed with clairvoyant
powers that enabled it to know beforehand what
the opponent meant to do. That the First had learned
the Scrub signals had occurred to the latter, only to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
promptly rejected. Neither Coach Otis nor Captain
Lothrop would profit by such an advantage. Yet,
merely to make a certainty more sure, or, perhaps, because
no other remedy suggested itself, the signals,
already changed when Clem Henning had joined the
enemy forces, had been switched again since play had
started. So that couldn’t be it.</p>

<p>Yet something was wrong. The Scrub wasn’t playing
any slower than usual; in fact, both line and backfield
were almost beating the ball; and yet to-day the
only safe play for the Scrub was a punt, and even one
of those had been nearly blocked! “Cocky” puzzled
and wracked his brain without finding the solution, and
the Scrub went back to the massacre still perplexed
and irritated. Yet the second scrimmage period wasn’t
so bad, for there was only one more score by the First,
and the Scrub made four first downs and got within
twenty yards of the enemy’s goal. Nevertheless it was
a chastened and somewhat dazed squad which made its
weary way back to the gymnasium in the early dusk.
Perhaps the defeated army after Waterloo felt about
the way the Scrub did. Yesterday they had been,
to-day they were not. And no one was able to say
why!</p>

<p>No one in the Scrub, that is. Almost any member
of the First Team could have explained the mystery
very promptly had he chose. But he didn’t choose.
The First merely looked superior and a little bit contemptuous;
and it took two Firsts and three Scrubs
to separate Al Greene and “Swede” Hanbury in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
shower room after “Swede” had made what sounded
like a perfectly innocent observation regarding the
afternoon’s proceedings. Even so the peacemakers
didn’t intervene in time to prevent bloodshed, for Al
was sniffing through an ensanguined nose as he was led
protestingly away and “Swede” was working his jaws
experimentally and prodding the left side of his chin
with an inquiring finger.</p>

<p>Beside the First Team members, however, the secret
of the Scrub’s overthrow was known to one other at
least. Loring, seated in his chair beyond the third
turn of the running track, attended by the faithful Wattles,
had used his eyes and his book-learned knowledge
of football to advantage, and so, after supper, when
Tom did not appear promptly at the room on the first
floor of East, Wattles was sent in search of him. As
Tom was in Mr. Babcock’s study just then, Wattles
failed to find him. Clif, encountered by Wattles in a
corridor, was of no assistance, for Clif had been searching
for Tom himself. But Clif agreed to deliver the
message when the missing one was found, and Wattles
returned to report failure. Clif didn’t find an opportunity
to deliver that message, however, until he ran
into Tom on the way to assembly hall, and so it wasn’t
until after study hour that the two reached Loring’s
room. Tom had done very little studying, for the
fact that Loring had sent for him had plunged him into
a sea of conjecture. It might just be that Loring could
throw light on the engrossing mystery. The chap was
certainly sharp! Already he had offered two or three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
suggestions that, passed on to Coach Babcock, had been
adopted to the betterment of the Scrub. Tom had
acknowledged to Clif no later than Saturday that
Loring was really being of use!</p>

<p>“Say,” demanded Tom anxiously when Clif had
closed the door behind them, “what’s on your mind,
Loring?”</p>

<p>“What’s on yours?” asked Loring smilingly.</p>

<p>Tom groaned. “Not a thing in the world, old son!
Nothing but the trifling recollection of having been
licked 23 to 0 this afternoon. Come on! Spill it!
I know you’ve got some sort of dope.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know one reason why you got beaten so
badly, Tom.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“First jumped you every time.”</p>

<p>“O Sacred Ibis of the River Nile!” wailed Tom. “Is
that the best you can do? Listen, Loring. Strange
as it may sound to you, quite a few of us guessed that
about five hours ago!”</p>

<p>“And did you also guess why?” asked Loring
sweetly.</p>

<p>“We guessed, yes, but they were rotten guesses. Do
<em>you</em> know?”</p>

<p>“I think I do. The answer is ‘Jackson.’”</p>

<p>“Sim? How do you mean?” Tom sat up straight
and opened his eyes widely.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you notice that after the first few minutes
of the second period you fellows began to make your
plays go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, they certainly went better in the second show.”</p>

<p>“And after Duval went in at quarter for Jackson?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that’s so! But what—how—”</p>

<p>“Tom, if the other fellow tells you a second beforehand
when the ball’s going into play isn’t that a bit
of a help to you? Doesn’t it allow you to beat the ball
a bit?”</p>

<p>“You mean that Sim gave the play away? I
mean—”</p>

<p>“Yes. Remember that First was penalized twice for
off-side? Well, it ought to have been penalized half
a dozen more times. It would have been if I’d been
refereeing. Those fellows watched Jackson and
started before the ball every time you had it. By the
time the runner got the ball there was no chance for
him. Two or three times—”</p>

<p>“But, great Scott, what did Jackson do? I didn’t
see anything wrong, Loring.”</p>

<p>“You were too close, Tom. I wish I had the use
of my legs so I could show you. Clif, you be Jackson
for a minute, like a good chap. All right. Give your
signals—wait, you’re turning this way now, bending
down. That’s it. ‘Signals!’ Now then, you turn
toward the center. You’ve had your left hand, or your
right, maybe, on the center’s back while you’ve
been giving the signal, but now you drop it and
hold your hands for the ball. Act it out that way,
please.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” laughed Clif. “Signals! Twenty-three,
forty-three, seventeen! Twenty-three, forty-three—”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
He dropped his right hand from an imaginary back
and—</p>

<p>“See it?” exclaimed Loring.</p>

<p>Tom shook his head in puzzlement as Clif straightened
up again. “Why, his shoulder, man!” said
Loring impatiently. “First it’s way up like this where
half the First Team’s linemen can see it. Then it disappears
and after you’ve counted two the ball is
snapped. That’s as regular as—as—why, it never
fails! I timed it half a dozen times, Tom. Down
went Jackson’s shoulder and from three-quarters to a
second afterwards Ridgway snapped. Some one found
that out and spread it. Now the First Team forwards
watch Jackson’s shoulder instead of the ball or the men
in front of them and when it ducks they charge. Sometimes
they were past the line before the ball was in
Jackson’s hands. If there had been a linesman he
would have penalized First six or eight times; almost
every time you chaps had the ball in the first half; but
a referee or an umpire can’t see that sort of thing from
where he stands. When Duval went in you began to
make your plays good because the First wasn’t being
tipped off when to start.”</p>

<p>“Heck!” murmured Tom. “So that was it! A simple
little thing like that! My sainted Aunt Jerusha!
And no one saw it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what your blamed old aunt’s got to do
with it,” objected Clif disgustedly. “I’ve said all along,
and so has Loring, that we ought to cut out passing
to the quarter except when—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the difference?” demanded Tom. “Sim
would do the same thing if the pass was direct to the
runner. He’s got to learn to keep his shoulder out
of sight. Either that or quit! Say, I’ve known backs
who gave the play away by shifting or moving their
feet or something, but this is the first time I ever heard
of a quarter giving the other team a starting signal!
Heck, wouldn’t that jar you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad we know what’s wrong,” said Clif
thankfully. “To-morrow—”</p>

<p>“To-morrow! Say, I’ve got to see ‘Cocky’!” Tom
jumped for the door. “Loring, you win the spun
glass crow-bar, old son! See you later!”</p>

<p>Then the door slammed.</p>

<p>Three minutes later Tom was enlightening a surprised,
relieved and somewhat chagrined “Cocky.” But
after several minutes of explanations and questions and
comments the coach suddenly looked puzzled. “But
look here, Kemble. An hour ago you didn’t know any
more than I did. How does it happen you come along
now and—”</p>

<p>“Loring Deane,” said Tom. “Let me tell you about
him, sir.”</p>

<p>So Tom told, ending with: “Two or three things
I spoke to you about weren’t my ideas at all. They
were his. I wasn’t trying to swipe the credit for them,
Mr. Babcock, but I thought you’d think I was sort of
crazy if I told you about Loring. Heck, I only did
it because the poor guy wanted to get in on football.
He’s a regular nut, sir. Then, blamed if he didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
come across with two or three good ideas, like the one
about playing Bingham close in on forward-passes to
the right, and it just seemed easier to let you think
that they were brain-waves of my own than explain.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, it looks to me, Kemble, as though it
would be a rather brilliant idea to encourage Deane.
Guess we’d better attach him to our ‘coaching staff,’”
Mr. Babcock added laughingly.</p>

<p>“I wish he would let you see some of the plays he’s
planned. Some of them look pretty good to me, but
I’m not much of a hand at diagrams.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see them, of course,” replied Mr. Babcock,
not very enthusiastically. “Bring them along
some evening.”</p>

<p>“I spoke about that, sir, but he didn’t seem keen
for it. He’s got a forward-pass play, with an end
throwing, that looks sort of good, and I was wondering
if we couldn’t try it out, Mr. Babcock. There’s a lot
of us who would like mighty well to beat Minster High
next Saturday. And then, of course, we’ve <em>got</em> to lick
that Wolcott Scrub!”</p>

<p>“I’ll drop in on Deane to-morrow and get him to
show me what he’s got. I’d like to make his acquaintance,
too. Oh, by the way, Kemble, there’s something
I meant to speak of when you were in here before.
How are you getting on in classes?”</p>

<p>“Me, sir? Well, I’m all right, I guess. Of course,
I’m not what you could call a shining example right
now, Mr. Babcock, but as soon as football’s over I’ll
be sitting pretty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“Hm. Well, if I were you I’d find plenty of time
for studying, my boy. In fact, I’d make rather an
effort just now, because it wouldn’t do to have something
come up and prevent you from playing. Think
it over, will you? A word to the wise, as they say.
Good night.”</p>

<p>“Now,” reflected Tom, as he made his way back
to East, “just what did he mean by that? Some one’s
been talking, and I’ll bet it’s that old ‘Alick.’ Maybe
I’d better try to make a better showing with him. He’s
been looking sort of mean lately. Yes, sir, I’d just
better get back on ‘Alick’s’ good side.”</p>

<p>Wednesday’s sensation was the showing of the
Scrub against the First in two periods of fifteen and
ten minutes each. With Charlie Duval at quarter most
of the time, the Scrub held the enemy on the defense
all through the first period and, while it wasn’t able
to get across the goal-line, it made the adversary play
harder for some minutes than it had played all the
fall. In the second period, with many substitutes present
on both teams, the First got the upper hand and
managed to hold it, finally working the ball close to
the Scrub’s goal and losing it when Ogden fumbled
a pass from center. A few minutes later it tried a desperate
attempt at a goal from the thirty-six yards and
missed it narrowly. Following that, with less than
three minutes left, Scrub faked a punt and sent Tom
galloping past left tackle to midfield. Tom was having
one of his good days, and now, aided and abetted by
Johnny Thayer, he secured two more first downs before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
First steadied and stopped the onslaught. After
Johnny had punted over the line the whistle blew and
ended the scoreless battle.</p>

<p>Loring had a tale to tell that evening. Mr. Babcock
had been in to see him just after dinner and they had
had a wonderful talk about football and the Scrub Team
and those plays of his, for “Cocky” had made him
show them, saying that Tom had told about them.
“And he went away with four of them,” said Loring,
trying to conceal his delight. “Said he wanted to
study them and that if they looked all right he’d have
you fellows try them out some day soon.”</p>

<p>“Did he take that forward-pass from end?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he was looking at that a long time. Say,
wouldn’t it be corking if that worked all right?”</p>

<p>“Work? Of course it will work. It’ll go big.
Mark my words, old son.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. Maybe there’s a weak spot
somewhere. Mr. Babcock says you can’t really tell a
whole lot about plays until you’ve actually tried them
out against another team.”</p>

<p>“That one’s all right,” replied Tom confidently. “I’d
like to use it against Minster next Saturday and get it
working nicely for the Wolcott Scrub. I like that
play. I’ll bet it turns out to be the cheese, old son!”</p>

<p>That settled, he and Loring arranged the chess-men
and Clif settled himself with a book. At five minutes
to eight, the game being still undecided, the board was
set aside until after study hour and Tom hurried up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
to Number 34 for his books. Billy Desmond met him
at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>“‘Alick’s’ been looking for you, Tom,” announced
Billy casually. “Wants to converse with you in his
study, young feller.”</p>

<p>“‘Alick’! Golly! Say, did he look—er—pleasant?”</p>

<p>“Extremely jovial, I thought.”</p>

<p>Tom groaned. “There’s breakers ahead then. He’s
always sweet and pleasant just before he bites! Well, he
will have to wait until after study. Heck, I wish
I’d put in more time on my English this morning, instead
of wasting it on math!”</p>

<p>Clif pushed Loring’s chair along the corridor after
study hour and informed him that the chess game was
going to be delayed. “Tom’s got to see Mr. Wyatt,
and he’s scared to death.” Clif chuckled. “Wyatt’s
the only person he ever was scared of, I guess!”</p>

<p>“I hope ‘Alick’ isn’t going to be nasty,” said Loring
uneasily. “You know, Clif, Tom’s an awful dumbbell
about English. Yesterday I thought ‘Alick’ was
going to have a conniption when Tom gave those perfectly
inane answers about ‘The Ancient Mariner.’”</p>

<p>“He was quaint,” laughed Clif. “But I guess
‘Alick’s’ just reading him the riot-act. Hang it, you
know, Tom <em>does</em> try!”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, I know, but—” Loring shook his head.
“Oh, well, he will pull through. He’s an awfully
lucky dub!”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, however, the lucky dub didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
look the part as, closing the door of Number 4 West
behind him, he thrust his hands into his pockets and
stared dazedly down the short corridor. He stood
there a long minute before, with a shrug and a hardening
of his features, he made his way briskly around
the corner and set out for East Hall. He did a great
deal of thinking on the way, but the more he thought
the less happy he became, and when he at last reached
Loring’s room he had to pause for an instant to wet his
lips and work his face back into shape. When he went
in he was grinning, and, since Clif had grown to know
him fairly well by now, there was one occupant of the
room not deceived by that grin. Loring asked anxiously:
“Was he bad, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Well, depends,” replied Tom, seating himself with
unusual decorum. “What would you call bad, old
son?”</p>

<p>“Why—”</p>

<p>But Clif interrupted bruskly. “What’s he done,
Tom? Don’t act the fool! Let’s hear it.”</p>

<p>“All right! He’s handed me a dirty wallop, if you
must know, the old skunk! I’m on restriction.”</p>

<p>“Restriction!” exclaimed Loring. “Why, then—then
you can’t—”</p>

<p>“So he very carefully reminded me,” said Tom bitterly.
“Oh, he didn’t forget anything! Said the Office
had had my case under consideration for some time
and that only my standing in other studies had kept
them from giving me the ax before. Said maybe if
my time wasn’t so taken up with football I’d—” Tom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
stopped and shook his head. “Oh, he put the harpoon
into me good and hard, and turned it around a couple
of times. Well, I’m done for this season.”</p>

<p>“But, great Scott, isn’t he going to let you make up—or
something?” demanded Clif. “He can’t keep you
from playing all the rest of the season, can he? Why,
there’s more than two weeks yet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, I can make up,” laughed Tom grimly.
“All I’ve got to do is get eighty or better from now on,
write a nice little theme of five hundred words on
Coleridge’s ‘Ancient Mariner’—five hundred, mind
you!—and make up some stuff in paragraph structure
that I fell down on Monday. Oh, sure, I can make up
all right!”</p>

<p>“Well, but how long have you got to—to—”</p>

<p>“Friday afternoon for the theme. Heck, what’s the
use of talking about it? I couldn’t write a hundred
words about that blamed old mariner, let alone five
hundred! And then getting eighty! Why, hang it,
I’ve never got better than sixty-five in English, and
I never expect to! It’s rotten stuff, and I hate it.
Composition and rhetoric, and the whole blamed business!
No, sir, I’m plumb through!”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, through?” asked Clif sharply.</p>

<p>Tom’s gaze dropped to the floor, and for a moment
he made no answer. Then he shrugged his shoulders.
“Well, what do you think?” he asked bitterly.
“Wouldn’t you call it through?” Then, after a pause.
“I dare say you fellows will make Johnny Thayer
captain.”</p>

<small>LORING TAKES COMMAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The chess game was never finished. Ten
o’clock arrived with nothing much left to be
said, and with scant lessening of the general
gloom. Loring insisted that by trying hard Tom could
get that theme handed in by the designated time, that
he could make up the other stuff easily, and that, if he
really set his mind on it, he could keep his English
work up to the required standard. But even Loring
realized that a little over two weeks was scant time
in which to convince a sceptical instructor of one’s reform,
and that, with the best of luck, Tom could
scarcely hope for reinstatement early enough to be of
much further use to the Scrub. Clif’s best suggestion
was that Tom see his adviser the first thing in the
morning, and ask him to intercede. Tom agreed to do
this, but plainly he was not hopeful. Mr. Parks and
he had not taken to each other greatly, and Tom’s secret
conviction was that “Cheese” wouldn’t be likely to go
to much trouble in the matter. Finally they parted,
Clif accompanying Tom to the door of Number 34
and leaving him with a lugubrious “Oh, well, cheer up,
Tom. Maybe it won’t be so bad.”</p>

<p>At breakfast Tom was strangely cheerful and ate a
hearty repast. Yet nothing had happened to better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the situation, and Clif was puzzled. Of course if Tom
had decided to accept conditions philosophically, and
make the best of them, Clif was pleased, but there was
something in the other’s manner, a sort of under surface
excitement, that prevented Clif from being quite
satisfied with that explanation. And then, too, Tom
was so casual when Clif detained him in the corridor
after breakfast. His replies to the other boy’s questions
were brief and vague. Yes, he was going to see
“Cheese” right now. And “Cocky” afterward. That
theme? Well, yes, he might have a go at that later.
When Clif called “Good luck!” after him as he turned
down the corridor he said: “Thanks, old son,” and
waved a hand almost gayly.</p>

<p>The interview with Mr. Parks was not disappointing
only because Tom had not hoped that anything would
come of it. The French instructor firmly refused to
interfere in the matter, and even managed to make Tom
feel that he had committed a breach of ethics in proposing
such a course. Not, however, that Tom troubled
about it. He thanked “Cheese” most courteously—so
courteously, in fact, that the instructor frowned suspiciously—and
withdrew. Several times during the
forenoon Clif ran across him in the corridors, and at
two recitations they occupied adjacent seats, and Clif’s
puzzlement increased rather than diminished. Tom
neither looked nor acted his part. Clif confided the
fact to Loring, adding uneasily: “He’s up to something,
and I’ll bet it’s something crazy. I wish I knew what.”</p>

<p>The Scrub did not choose a new captain. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the chance that Tom would square himself with the
Office and return to his duties, and so the Scrub sent
word to Tom to appoint a temporary leader and Tom’s
choice was Johnny Thayer, the fullback. That afternoon
the First had very little trouble with the Scrub,
and scored three times, holding its own goal-line inviolate.
Tom’s absence, both as halfback and captain,
was felt. With a game against Minster High School
two days off the Scrub’s showing that Thursday afternoon
wasn’t encouraging.</p>

<p>Loring returned to East after the day’s practice was
over, a little disappointed. Not because of the Scrub’s
rather sorry exhibition, but because he had hoped
that Mr. Babcock would try out his forward-pass play
in practice, and Mr. Babcock hadn’t done it. Loring
supposed that Tom’s absence from the team had prevented,
and concluded that he would have to wait until
next season for a test of the play.</p>

<p>Loring was still eating supper when Clif, looking
much disturbed, was admitted by Wattles. “He wasn’t
in dining hall,” announced the visitor, “and I’ve looked
all over the place for him! He hasn’t been here, has
he?”</p>

<p>“Tom? No, I haven’t seen him since noon. He’s
around somewhere, though, of course!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Clif but without conviction. “Just
the same, it’s not like him to miss a meal. He’s never
done it before.”</p>

<p>“Have you tried the library? You know, he might
be working on that theme.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve looked everywhere I could think of except at
‘J. W.’s,’ and he was still at supper a few minutes ago.
I don’t see where he can be! Unless—gee, he may be
in my room! I’ll go and see.”</p>

<p>He hurried out, but five minutes later he was back.
“He wasn’t there,” he said in reply to Loring’s mute
question, “but I found this. It was on the table.” He
drew an envelope from a pocket, and, with an uneasy
glance at Wattles, laid it on Loring’s tray.</p>

<p>“You needn’t mind Wattles,” said Loring. He drew
the single sheet of paper from the envelope, and, with
Clif leaning over his shoulder, read the message it
bore: “Dear old Clif, I’m pulling out in half an hour.
Something told me a long while back that I wasn’t
going to like this place, and the hunch was dead right.
I’m going home to-night, and I guess I’ll be back on
the old High School Team by next week. Tell Billy
to give you the bundle wrapped in blue paper in my
top drawer. It’s those golf hose you always liked,
the ones with the green and yellow tops. I’m going to
miss you, old son, but we’ll get together somehow at
Christmas if it can be managed. Keep this mum until
to-morrow. I’ve got to see the guardian before he
gets word from the School. Well, old son, here’s luck,
and I hope we win from Wolcott even if I don’t see it.
Give my best to Loring. And tell Wattles Cheer-io!
Yours to the last whistle, T.A.K.—P.S. I’ll write you
in a day or two. If old Winslow’s nasty I’ll probably
hike out somewhere on my own. I’ll let you know so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
you can drop me a line sometimes, and tell me how
things are going. T.”</p>

<p>Loring slid the sheet back into the envelope, and
returned it to Clif in silence. Clif as silently thrust the
note back into a pocket. Then: “Wattles, you might
take this tray, please,” said Loring, and, when Wattles
had reached the door with his burden, “I say, get hold
of a time-table and fetch it back with you.”</p>

<p>“That’s no good,” said Clif as the door closed. “He
got the six-thirty-four train, and it’s twelve minutes to
seven now.”</p>

<p>“When’s the next one south?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. About nine, I think.”</p>

<p>“Does the six-thirty-something go through to New
York?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I guess you have to change at
Danbury. There are only two through trains, I think;
the eleven in the morning, and the two-something in
the afternoon. Even suppose he has to lie over at
Danbury, though, he’d be gone before we could get
there. And neither of us could go, anyhow!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a look at the time-table first,” said Loring.
“Tom’s done a perfectly idiotic thing, Clif, and
he oughtn’t to be allowed to get away with it.
He’s probably sorry already. Anyway, he will be
in the morning, and the morning will be too late.
We’ve got to get him back here to-night—somehow!”</p>

<p>“I wish we could,” agreed Clif desperately, “but I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
don’t believe there’s a train back from Danbury before
morning, even if I got there before he’d left. Besides,
if he didn’t want to come back with me I couldn’t <em>make</em>
him, could I? He’s beastly stubborn. And I’d have
to cut study hour, and if faculty found it out we’d
<em>both</em> be in wrong.”</p>

<p>“No, you couldn’t go,” said Loring. “There’d be
no sense in you getting into trouble, too. And, as you
say, you couldn’t make him come back if he didn’t
want to. And even if he really wanted to, he probably
wouldn’t. He’d be ashamed to quit and turn back, I
guess. No, you wouldn’t do, Clif.”</p>

<p>“Then who—what—”</p>

<p>But just then Wattles returned with the time-table,
and Loring eagerly spread it open before him. “Get
a pencil, Clif, and stand by, will you? All set? Leave
Freeburg 6:34. Arrive Danbury 9:07. That’s a slow
old train! Leave Danbury for New York—wait a
minute. Yes, that’s right. Leave Danbury 9:52.
Arrive New York 11:35. Got it? Now let’s see about
the next one. Leave Freeburg—leave Freeburg—leave—
Here we are! Leave Freeburg 8:54. Arrive
Danbury 11:02. Hm, that’s an hour and ten minutes
too late. No use trying to catch him by train,
Wattles.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” agreed Wattles impassively.</p>

<p>“No, it can’t be done. Are we broke, Wattles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, I believe there’s something like forty
dollars in the trunk, and I have a small sum on me,
sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“Say, fifty altogether? That may do. You might
see just what we <em>have</em> got.”</p>

<p>“I have three or four dollars,” said Clif eagerly.</p>

<p>“With you?”</p>

<p>“No, but—”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother. We’ve probably enough. What do
you say, Wattles?”</p>

<p>“Fifty-five, sir, and a bit of change.”</p>

<p>“Plenty! All right. You know what to do, Wattles.
Bring him back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but if the young gentleman shouldn’t care
to return?”</p>

<p>“I’d use persuasion, Wattles; any kind.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” exclaimed Clif, “do you mean you’re
going to send Wattles?”</p>

<p>“Unless you can suggest some one better,” answered
Loring. “I’d make certain first of all that he really got
off on that six-thirty-four. He might have missed it,
although he probably didn’t. Perhaps the agent will
remember him. After that—well, Danbury’s around
sixty miles, I believe, and it oughtn’t to take you more
than an hour and a half at this time of night. It’s
now seven-nine, so you ought to fetch there by—let’s
see; allowing for delays in getting started, by nine or
a few minutes later. So you’ll probably get to Danbury
about the same time that he does. That’ll allow
you about forty-five minutes to make him see sense.
Tell him we sent word that if he comes back with you
no one will know he ever went off. I’ll leave this
window here wide open, Wattles, and he ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
able to get to his room without being seen. Better
stop the car well down the street. Don’t try to get
back before midnight, either. Better give folks here
a chance to get to sleep. And, Wattles.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Wattles had taken an overcoat from
the closet, and now, his black derby in hand, he stood
rigidly at attention, his long countenance even more
than usually solemn.</p>

<p>“It will be worth five dollars extra to the man who
drives you if he forgets all about it by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“So I was thinking, Mister Loring. There’s a fellow
works in the garage who has a car of his own,
sir, and as we’ve struck up a bit of an acquaintance,
sir, I fancy he would be quite the chap for the—er—undertaking.”</p>

<p>“Good! Better put this memorandum of the trains
in your pocket. Got the money?”</p>

<p>Wattles tapped the inside pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>“Then go to it! I’ll expect you back about midnight.
Good luck, Wattles!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.” Wattles reached the door and
paused, a hand on the knob. “You understand, Mister
Loring, I am doing this with the understanding you’re
not to leave the chair until I get back, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, absolutely, Wattles! Cross my heart. You’ll
find me right here. I may be asleep, but I’ll stick to
the jolly old chair!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Wattles again. Then the
door closed behind him, and Loring, chuckling, looked
at his watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“Eleven minutes past,” said Loring. “Fifteen minutes
to get to the village and find his man. Five minutes
to get started. Five minutes more at the station.
Barring accidents, Clif, he ought to roll into Danbury
by nine-ten.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” Clif agreed, “but if Tom is still set
on going home I guess Wattles won’t be able to do
much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Wattles will fetch him,” said Loring confidently.
“Now it’s up to us to fix things at this end.
What about his absence from supper? Suppose it was
noticed?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, but that doesn’t matter. If a fellow
doesn’t want to come to his meals he doesn’t have to.
No one’s going to bother about that, but if he’s missed
from assembly hall it’s good night! I wonder who’s
in charge to-night!”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I’d forgotten about study hour.” Loring
thoughtfully thumbed the pages of the time-table.
Finally; “Say, is it hard to get permission to cut study
hour, Clif?”</p>

<p>“Gee, I don’t know. I never tried it. Why?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking that if Tom got permission to
stay away, because of illness or something, he might
get by.”</p>

<p>“Of course, but how can he get excused if he isn’t
here to ask?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you do it for him?”</p>

<p>The two boys observed each other in thoughtful
silence for a moment. Then Clif’s eyes lighted. “Gee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
I might!” he exclaimed. “Only—well, I’d sort of hate
to have to lie, Loring.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it. Listen. Here’s how you work it.”
Loring’s voice dropped a tone and Clif hitched his
chair closer.</p>

<small>WATTLES USES COERCION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Is it necessary, sir, for Tom Kemble to ask for
permission to cut study hour himself?”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Mr. McKnight, smiling.
“If Kemble cut study hour he would have to do it
himself, wouldn’t he Bingham?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I meant, does he have to ask himself?”</p>

<p>“It would be much better if he asked me, or one of
the other faculty members,” responded “Lovey”
gravely. “His own permission, supposing he obtained
it, would hardly be sufficient, I fear.”</p>

<p>Clif laughed. For once he didn’t find Mr. McKnight’s
fooling very funny, but he must be diplomatic.
“I guess I can’t say it right, sir, but you know mighty
well what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I suspect I do, Bingham. Kemble wants to be excused
from study hour, and has sent you as his ambassador.
I am to presume, I fancy, that he is too
ill to make the request himself. Or does he think that
you’ll prove more successful than he would?” Mr.
McKnight’s eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Clif earnestly, “it really isn’t
that way, Mr. McKnight. He—he isn’t able to come.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. It isn’t anything serious, I hope.” The
instructor’s voice was so genuinely sympathetic that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Clif felt ashamed of the deception he was attempting.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, sir. He didn’t go down to supper,
but I guess he will be all right by morning.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I’m not so sure, though, you shouldn’t
have gone to some one on Kemble’s floor. He’s in 34,
isn’t he? However, as you are acting in his behalf,
and you are on my floor, I’ll take the responsibility of
excusing him. Is he in bed?”</p>

<p>“N-no, sir. That is, he wasn’t when I was up there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, better tell him to get to bed, Bingham. That’s
the best place for him, no matter what’s wrong. Probably
just an upset of his tummy. You chaps take awful
chances, the way in which you stuff yourselves with
sweet chocolate and peanuts and Heaven only knows
what! By the way, Kemble’s on restriction, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He got in wrong with ‘Alick’—I mean
Mr. Wyatt!”</p>

<p>Mr. McKnight’s nose twitched, but he didn’t smile.
“Too bad. I dare say that’s upset him somewhat, too.
I’ll look in on him a little later and see if he needs
anything.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he doesn’t, sir,” said Clif hurriedly, striving
to keep the sound of panic from his voice. “I
think he means to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Best thing for him. Tell him it’s all right about
study hour, Bingham, and that he’s to get into bed.
I don’t want to find him up, reading stories, when I
call!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I mean no, sir!” stammered Clif. “I’ll
tell him. I don’t believe he’d want you to bother about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
looking in on him, though.” Then, seeing or fancying
he saw, the dawning of suspicion in “Lovey’s”
eyes, Clif abandoned that line quickly. “Well, thank
you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Bingham.” When the visitor had gone
Mr. McKnight protruded his lower lip, closed his eyes
slightly and stared thoughtfully at the ink-well.
Finally he shook his head. “If it were any one but
Bingham, now,” he murmured, “I’d be inclined to suspect
that something had been put over on me!”</p>

<p>Upstairs again, in Number 34, Clif related to Billy
Desmond, in a somewhat small voice, the result of his
visit. “Gee, if he does come up it’s all off! What’ll
I do, Billy? I didn’t lie to him, but he will think I
did, and I’d hate that!”</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Billy, pinching his nose as an aid to
concentration of thought, “there’s just one chance,
Clif, and we’ll have to risk it.” From his closet he
gathered an armful of clothing, turned down Tom’s
immaculate bed, heaped the clothing on the sheet and
pulled blankets and coverlet back into place. From the
end of the room the illusion was only fairly successful,
but when Billy had turned the light out, and opened the
corridor door, admitting the wan radiance from without,
none but the most suspicious would have doubted
that Tom lay there fast asleep, his head covered by the
sheet. Billy chuckled approvingly. Then he threw a
pair of his own trousers and a towel, and an old coat
over the back of the chair by Tom’s bed and tucked
a pair of shoes underneath it. After that, still chuckling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
at intervals, Billy got his books and closed the
door behind himself and Clif.</p>

<p>“That’s the best we can do,” he said, as they made
their way down the stairs. “It may fool him and it
may not. The rest, Clif, is in the lap of the gods!”</p>

<p>It was about half-past eight when Mr. McKnight
finished Chopin’s Waltz in G Flat Major, and arose
from the piano. Study hour was the one hour of the
twenty-four in which he felt at liberty to use the piano
to his heart’s content, and he was loth to lose the time
entailed by a visit to Number 34. Even after he was
on his feet another sheet of music caught his eye, and
he opened it on the rack and tentatively fingered the
first bars before finally and resolutely tearing himself
away. The corridors were pleasantly silent as he made
his way upstairs and tapped lightly at the closed portal
of Number 34. There was no reply, and he turned
the knob and thrust the door inward. The room was
in darkness and no sound came to him. Evidently
his advice had been acted on, for Kemble was not only
in bed but sleeping extraordinarily peacefully. Mr.
McKnight’s gaze took in the shoes beneath the chair,
and the garments above. The sleeper remained undisturbed,
oblivious of the intrusion. The instructor
smiled as he closed the door softly again and walked
noiselessly away.</p>

<p>“Nothing much wrong with him, I guess, if he can
sleep like that,” he told himself as he sought the stairway.
“Probably be all right when he wakes up.” Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
his thoughts went forward to the piece of music on the
piano rack, and his steps became swifter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That ride to Danbury was long and wearisome to
Tom. Waiting in the shadows of the station at Freeburg,
after he had decided not to risk purchasing a
ticket, but to pay his fare on the train, had been sort
of exciting, and even after the station lights and the
lights of the town itself had faded behind him a certain
zest in the adventure had remained. But soon,
what with the overheated car, the uncomfortable seat,
the numerous stops and the dust that drifted in at every
opening, the excitement dwindled fast. At the end of
an hour he had begun to doubt the brilliancy of the
exploit. For one thing, it was going to be extremely
hard sledding to convince his guardian that he had
taken the right course; the more so since Tom hadn’t
yet succeeded in convincing himself. Mr. Winslow, an
estimable gentleman despite Tom’s prejudices, was a
lawyer, and, being a lawyer, his judgment was not
easily swayed. You just had to have a good case, and
Tom was horribly afraid he hadn’t! Well, one thing
was certain. If Old Winslow insisted on his returning
to Wyndham he just wouldn’t! No, sir, he’d run away
first. Maybe he’d go to sea. No, he wouldn’t, either.
You couldn’t play football at sea! But he’d go somewhere.</p>

<p>Then there was Clif. He had grown to be rather
fond of Clif. Until six weeks ago he had never had a
real chum. He had been friendly with lots of fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
but close to none. He was going to miss Clif a whole
lot; was missing him already, in fact. And there was
Billy, too; and Loring Deane. They were, all three,
corking chaps, and back home there wouldn’t be any
one to take their places. If it wasn’t that it was already
too late—</p>

<p>He pushed his suitcase forward where he could set
his feet on it, let his knees dig into the back of the
seat in front, and moodily stared along the length of
the ill-lighted coach. No, it was too late to change his
mind. Study hour was almost over now, and they’d
have discovered his absence long since. Besides, there
probably wasn’t any way of getting back, even if he
wanted to; and, of course, he didn’t. Wyatt had
played him a rotten trick, and to-morrow the old pest
would maybe realize it! And, anyway, what was the
good of being back there when he couldn’t play football
again this season? Heck, he had done just what any
fellow with an ounce of gumption and spirit would
do, and he was glad of it!</p>

<p>These reflections brought him to the lights of the
junction, and a few minutes later he was descending
the car steps, one of a half-hundred passengers from
the north. To find himself staring into the solemnly
respectful countenance of Wattles was such a surprising
experience that it was several seconds before he
found his voice, and during those seconds his suitcase
was removed from his grasp. Finally: “Why,
Wattles, were you on that train?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I came by car,” replied the other. “Quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
a bit colder, sir, isn’t it? One can do with a coat to-night,
Mister Tom, and I see you have yours with
you.” Suitcase in hand, Wattles led the way around
the end of the station, and it was not until he had
started across the track on the farther side that Tom
realized what was happening.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Wattles! What’s the idea?” he asked,
stopping.</p>

<p>“The car’s just over here, sir.”</p>

<p>“What car? I didn’t order any car!”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Mister Loring and Mr. Clif sent it. I
was to tell you that everything was quite all right, sir.
It’s all absolutely <i lang="la">sub rosa</i>, Mister Tom. We’ll get
back to the school by midnight—”</p>

<p>“So that’s it?” Tom laughed roughly. “Expect
me to go back with you in the car, eh? Well, nothing
doing, Wattles. I’m off that dump for keeps. Let’s
have that bag, please.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir, but if you wouldn’t mind just coming
across to the car. I’ve a robe and you’ll be quite
warm. Your train doesn’t leave for rather more than
a half-hour, sir, and I’d like very much to deliver my
message, Mister Tom.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, all right,” Tom grumbled. “Go ahead.
But I’ll tell you right here and now, Wattles, that it’s
no good. It was mighty nice of them to do this, and
all that, but I’ve no idea of going back.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, sir. Thank you. Right this way.”</p>

<p>The car stood well away from the station, the street
lights revealing its black bulk, and the figure of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
driver on the front seat. Tom laughed as Wattles held
the tonneau door open. “Some class to you, Wattles!
Where’d you get the boat?”</p>

<p>“In the village, sir.” Wattles was unfolding a large
and heavy rug. “It’s not a new car, sir, but it’s really
most competent.”</p>

<p>“Funny idea—” began Tom, with a chuckle. Then;
“<em>Say! What are you trying—</em>”</p>

<p>The big robe which Wattles, standing beside him
in the back of the car, had spread open had enveloped
him. For the briefest instant Tom thought that Wattles,
meaning to lay the rug across his knees, had
stumbled against the suitcase and fallen against him.
But that idea vanished before the sudden knowledge
that Wattles had tricked him! He shouted protestingly,
but the folds of the thick cloth, dust laden and
odorous of the stable, were about his head, muffling
the outcry and almost choking him. He strove to get
to his feet, to push himself free, but in vain. Something,
a rope or a strap, cinched his arms to his body.
He kicked out wildly, felt himself slip from the seat
to the floor, found the suitcase under his shrouded
head, and knew that Wattles was sitting on his legs!</p>

<p>It had all taken less than a minute, and now the
driver had scrambled back to the front seat, and the
engine was shaking the car. Then they were moving.
Tom, panting from his exertions, relaxed and took a
long breath. Dust filled his throat and nostrils, and
he sneezed violently. Wrath induced one final struggle,
but, although momentarily unseated, Wattles remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
in command of the situation. Tom stopped writhing
and considered events with a fair degree of calmness.</p>

<p>The car, a good one although of ancient vintage,
after negotiating the streets of the town at moderate
speed, was now on a straight hard road, and the engine’s
voice arose to a louder song. Wattles, who
had removed his overcoat before meeting Tom—it
was a newish coat, and he wanted nothing unfortunate
to happen to it in case Tom proved obstinate—shivered
as, sitting sidewise on Tom’s legs, he strove to
keep his balance, and at the same time protect himself
from the rush of the cold night wind. It was a most
uncomfortable position, but Wattles was game. With
Wattles duty was duty, and he was prepared to sit
like that all the way back to Freeburg if necessary.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t necessary. Some ten minutes after
they had left the station there was a series of muffled
sounds from under the robe and Wattles, leaning
nearer, said: “Pardon, Mister Tom. Will you say
that again, please, sir?”</p>

<p>“I said if you don’t take this pesky thing off I’ll
smother!” answered Tom through the folds.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’m afraid it’s rather uncomfortable, and
I’m sure you’ll understand, sir, how much I deplore
the necessity of the—the methods—”</p>

<p>“I can’t hear what you’re saying!” shouted Tom in
exasperation. “<em>Take this off me! Let me out!</em>”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir, only, asking your pardon, Mister
Tom, I must have your agreement not to leave the
car.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“Go to thunder!” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Wattles retreated, shivering violently.
After a minute more sounds reached him from beneath
the rug and again he leaned closer.</p>

<p>“I’ll promise, Wattles, you blamed idiot! Only take
this horse blanket off me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, sir! Just a moment!” Wattles’s hands
were busied, the restraint vanished from Tom’s arms,
the awful robe dragged chokingly away from his face,
and he sat up, gasping. Wattles, balancing himself
precariously on his feet, was holding the robe and, as
shown by the brief radiance of a passing light, shivering
like an aspen. Tom could almost hear the chattering
of his teeth. That momentary vision of the
long, mournful countenance, agitated by the shivers
that chased up and down Wattles’s spine, was too much
for Tom. He forgot that he was dreadfully angry and
humiliated, and burst into wild laughter.</p>

<p>The driver turned an inquiring face, looked briefly,
and unemotionally gave his attention back to the road.
Wattles, fearing hysteria, looked down in grave anxiety,
and shivered harder than ever. At last: “For
the love of mud, Wattles, put your coat on!” gasped
Tom as he weakly pulled himself onto the seat.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, just what I was about to do, sir.” Nevertheless,
Wattles first placed the robe over Tom’s knees,
and tucked it about him carefully. Then, at last, he
managed to get his wavering hands into the armholes
of his coat, buttoned it tightly and seated himself at
the extreme limit of the wide seat. “If you’d prefer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
to sit in front, sir, I fancy you’d find it quite a bit
warmer.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right, but don’t be an ass, Wattles. Slide
over here and get some of this over you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mister Tom, but I’m very comfortable.”</p>

<p>“You do as I tell you,” commanded Tom ferociously.
“Mind you, Wattles, you and that pal of
yours there may be able to get the best of me when
I’m not looking for it, but I can lick either one or
both of you in a fair scrap. Here, lay this across and
sit on the edge of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And I’m quite certain you’d be a match
for us both, Mister Tom, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” agreed Tom, mollified. “Just the same,
Wattles, I’ve got to hand it to you for turning a neat
trick. I suppose, though, Loring planned that, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Wattles modestly. “Mister Loring
just said I was to bring you back. Beyond that,
sir, I was obliged to proceed quite on my own. Sorry,
sir, that the exigency of the occasion demanded a certain
amount of coercion.”</p>

<p>“Coercion! Is that what you call it, Wattles? Man,
you’re a scream!”</p>

<p>“Should I have said compulsion?” asked Wattles
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll say you should!” Tom’s spirits were rising
rapidly. Of course, he hadn’t meant to return to Wyndham;
hadn’t wanted to, indeed; but the matter had
been taken out of his hands, and, now that the die<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
was cast, he would make the best of it. And, sitting
there snuggled under the warm rug, with the old car
hitting on all six, with the nipping air stinging his
face, he listened to Wattles’s explanation of the events
leading up to his present situation and felt that the
best was mighty good!</p>

<small>A NEW PLAY IS TRIED OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Clif didn’t take Walter Treat into his confidence
that night. Not that he didn’t thoroughly
trust Walt’s discretion, but there was
no sense in taking chances. He wanted to stay awake,
and listen for sounds outside or in the Hall that would
announce Tom’s surreptitious return; for Loring’s absolute
confidence in Wattles’s powers of persuasion had
ultimately convinced Clif that Tom would return; but
after a heroic effort lasting some fifteen or twenty
minutes he had to give it up, and when Tom’s fortunes
again engrossed his mind, it was twenty-two
minutes past seven on Friday morning. Clif made a
record toilet, and was on his way to Number 34 before
Walter was more than half dressed. Billy Desmond
was alone in the room when Clif got there, but a mere
glance at Tom’s tumbled bed told the story.</p>

<p>“All right?” whispered Clif hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Guess so,” Billy chuckled. “He’s gone to wash.
All I know is that he was in bed when I woke up, and
I had the dickens of a time getting him out. He’s
still half asleep.”</p>

<p>Tom staggered in a moment later, looking rather
haggard, and very, very sleepy. His greeting to Clif
was a wan smile, but while he struggled into his clothes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
and Clif kept an anxious eye on his watch, he narrated
his adventures briefly, yawning cavernously the while.
“We got here about five minutes to twelve and stopped
the car over on Stoddard Street,” he concluded. “Then
Wattles and I went up the lane a ways, and headed
for East. Wattles had my bag. I’d forgotten about
the brook, and it was pretty dark, and so Wattles
stepped right into it. Luckily the bag got away from
him and landed on the bank. I helped him out, and
we got in Loring’s window, and I stuck the bag in
his closet and came on up here.”</p>

<p>“And no one saw you?” asked Clif anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t—” Tom yawned widely—“think so.”</p>

<p>“Fool’s luck,” commented Billy, slipping into his
coat, and heading for the door. “That’s all I’ve got
to say!”</p>

<p>“Go roll your hoop,” said Tom without rancor.</p>

<p>“Just the same, Tom, you know you were an absolute
dumbbell, now don’t you?” demanded Clif, as
he held the other’s jacket and tried to hurry him into
it.</p>

<p>“I guess so. I don’t know. How much time we
got?”</p>

<p>“Minute and a quarter.”</p>

<p>“Fine. I’ve made it in fifty seconds flat. Come on!”</p>

<p>That afternoon Loring did not attend practice. Instead,
he and Tom sat at opposite sides of the table
in Loring’s room and Tom, alternately despairing and
hopeful, worked on that theme. Loring gave no aid
in the actual writing, nor even in the composition, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
he did make helpful suggestions when Tom faltered,
and he did suggest numerous changes in spelling. It
was close to five o’clock when the minimum of five
hundred words was finally attained—with one word to
spare, according to Tom’s sixth count—and Tom hurried
across to West and delivered the result to Mr.
Wyatt. “Alick” glanced briefly at the three pages.
Then:</p>

<p>“Did you have any help on this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. If I hadn’t I’d never have got it written!”</p>

<p>“How much help, Kemble, and from whom?”</p>

<p>“Loring Deane, sir. I wrote it all myself. He
didn’t tell me what to say, but he kept after me until
I’d done it, and he sort of suggested things to—to
write about.”</p>

<p>“In your opinion then, it represents your efforts,
and not Deane’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! And, Mr. Wyatt, it was some effort!”</p>

<p>“Alick’s” customary gravity cracked just a little.
“Well, all right, my boy. I’ll let you be the judge.
Now see if you can’t come to class a lot better prepared
than you have been. And about that paragraph
structure business, Kemble. When do you want to
make up on that? This evening all right for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, gosh, Mr. Wyatt! Give me another day,
won’t you? I haven’t had time to study that at all,
sir!”</p>

<p>“If you’d kept up with the course, Kemble, you
wouldn’t have to study it now. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” agreed Tom sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and you’d be playing football to-day, too.
You know, Kemble, I told you when you first came that
I meant to teach you English. Remember? I might
have turned you down, and with good reason, in
which case you wouldn’t be here to-day. But I
stretched a point and passed you, giving you fair
warning, though, that I meant to ride you hard, my
boy. You can’t truthfully say that I didn’t warn you
of what was coming to you, can you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I understood. And I started out all right,
too, didn’t I, Mr. Wyatt? Wasn’t I doing pretty well
until—until just lately?”</p>

<p>“You’ve never done ‘pretty well,’ Kemble, but you
did show me for a while that you were trying, and as
long as I knew that I didn’t turn the screws. But
about two weeks ago you stopped trying. I warned
you several times, but you appeared to think I didn’t
mean it.”</p>

<p>“I got sort of busy about football, Mr. Wyatt. They
made me captain of the Scrub, and there was a good
deal to—think about, and—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know all that. Football is a fine game,
Kemble, and I’ve never said a word against it. But
football isn’t what you came here for. At least, I hope
it isn’t. In any case, it isn’t what your parents sent
you to Wyndham to learn, and the sooner you realize
that the better for you. I’ll give you until Monday
on that examination, but you must be prepared then.
Come to me here at seven Monday evening, and I’ll
hear you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>“Monday?” exclaimed Tom relievedly. “Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Wyatt. I’ll have it Monday all right!
You see if I don’t!”</p>

<p>“<em>You’ll</em> see if you don’t,” responded the instructor
grimly.</p>

<p>By not watching the Scrub Team practice that afternoon
Loring missed something that would have interested
him. The First called off the scrimmage, choosing
to spend the time in perfecting certain plays to be
used on the morrow against Toll’s, and so Mr. Babcock,
following “G. G.’s” example, devoted much of
the session to a general preparation for the Minster
High School game. But he also found time to try out
two of Loring’s plays, one of them the forward-pass
strategy that had aroused Tom’s interest. He had no
intention of using them against Minster, and so the
plays did not get beyond the first stage of development.
They were explained and the players were placed in
their correct positions, and then, several times at a
walk and several times at full speed, they were enacted
against an opposing line of ten substitutes. The forward-pass
play was rather intricate at first, or seemed
so, and perhaps it was just as well that Loring wasn’t
there to watch the players get tangled up. Their efforts
would doubtless have made him exceedingly nervous!
But the last time that Heard tossed the ball
back to Clif and Clif swept it forward down the field
the performance went with a very fair degree of snap
and smoothness. What Mr. Babcock’s verdict on the
play was did not appear. The second play, though,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
held forth small promise, and Clif didn’t have to await
“Cocky’s” judgment to know that it would not be
added to the Scrub’s equipment.</p>

<p>Loring, learning from Clif that the forward-pass
play had been experimented with, looked for some
word from Mr. Babcock, but none came that evening,
nor the next day. In fact, the following week was
well along before Loring heard again from the Scrub
coach. That Friday evening was largely spent by
Loring and Clif in trying to get Tom to acknowledge
that he had been several sorts of an idiot and that he
owed them the deepest gratitude for rescuing him from
a ruinous position. Tom, however, preferred to argue
about it. At heart, he knew that he had acted foolishly,
and was tremendously grateful, but he didn’t
intend to say so in so many words. The best they
could get from him was the acknowledgment that, now
that he <em>was</em> back, he was glad of it, and that it was
decent of them to take so much trouble about him. He
tried to get Loring—and, afterwards, Wattles—to tell
him how much the kidnaping expedition had cost so
that he could pay back the money. But Loring
wouldn’t tell, and Wattles’s countenance was absolutely
vacant when he was questioned on the subject. He
couldn’t seem to remember a thing! In the end Tom
gave up in despair and nursed a mild grouch for some
minutes. It was dissipated, however, when Loring got
Wattles to tell about falling into the brook. Not that
Wattles was intentionally humorous. Quite the contrary.
That was what made it so funny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>The First Team departed for Toll’s Academy at
eleven-thirty the next forenoon, twenty-eight strong.
The game would be the last real test before Wolcott
was encountered, and so the result was awaited with
a good deal of interest. Wolcott had defeated Toll’s
by 26 to 9 and Coach Otis’s warriors hoped to at least
equal that creditable performance. The students sent
the team off with confident and vociferous cheers before
they piled into dining hall for an early dinner
that would permit them to follow at one o’clock. Of
course not all the fellows made the trip, and amongst
the half-hundred or so who remained at Wyndham,
were, besides the Scrub Team members, Tom and
Loring.</p>

<p>Tom had somewhat testily declared his intention of
spending the afternoon in study, but Loring and Clif
had only grinned. The picture of Tom occupied in the
pursuit of knowledge while the Fighting Scrub battled
with an enemy somehow lacked distinctness! Anyhow,
Tom didn’t spend that afternoon in Number 34 West.
He occupied Wattles’s stool beside Loring’s chair,
which had been wheeled to the corner of the grand
stand, and he and Wattles, the latter slightly in the
background, watched proceedings with about equal interest.
It was a good game, a hard, fast, close contest
that wasn’t decided until, in the fourth period, while
the small audience held its collective breath, Hoppin,
sent in for the purpose, added a goal to the Scrub’s
second touchdown. Scrub had set out with the intention
of beating Minster High as thoroughly as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
First had, but when the second quarter had ended with
the score Minster High 6, Wyndham Scrub 6, that
laudable ambition had been modified. The Scrub concluded
on second thought to be satisfied with any sort
of a victory!</p>

<p>Jimmy Ames, back once more on the team, contributed
a good share toward the Scrub’s triumph, for it
was Jimmy who found a ball that no one seemed to
have any interest in at the moment, and, tucking it
into the crook of an elbow, sped thirty-eight yards
with it, and placed it three streaks distant from the
Minster goal-line. Johnny Thayer advanced it six and
Lou Stiles two yards. Then Heard, officiating in
Tom’s former position, got almost free outside tackle
on the right, and was piled up on the one yard, and
from there, although he had to make three tries,
Johnny took it across. Sim Jackson fumbled a poor
pass from “Babe,” and there was no goal. That was
in the first period. Minster scored her six points in
the second, aided by a fumble by Sim and a long
forward-pass that swept the visitors from just past
midfield to Scrub’s twenty-six yards. Twice Minster
fooled the defenders by the antiquated fullback run
from kicking position play, and finally tossed the pigskin
across the center for a twelve yard gain and a
touchdown. Minster, though, had even poorer luck
than the Scrub when it came to the try-for-point, for
the ball eluded the kicker entirely and rolled back to
the twenty yards before it was recovered. A subsequent
desperate attempt to run it back to the line was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
upset—as was the runner—by Clif, who made what
was possibly the one perfect tackle of his football
career to date.</p>

<p>Minster’s second score followed closely on the beginning
of the second half, and this time a blocked
punt gave her her chance. Johnny Thayer got the ball
away nicely enough, but in some manner a Minster forward
leaked through “Babe,” and his nose got squarely
in the path of the ball. There was no question about
that, for the evidence was prominent all during the
rest of the battle! The ball rebounded, probably in
great astonishment, and was secured by a Minster
guard on Scrub’s seventeen yards. From there the
visitors took it by short and certain plunges across the
line in just eight plays, and, although the pass was
good this time, and although the Minster quarter had
plenty of time to kick, the pigskin, perhaps still unnerved
by its recent experience, went wide of the goal.
So when, in the middle of the final period, Clif, taking
a forward-pass from Thayer on Minster’s twenty-six
yards, scampered with it across the last trampled white
mark, victory depended on the try-for-point. And
when “Hop” took Stiles’s place and sent the “old
melon” fair and true across the bar the small contingent
of Wyndhamites made enough noise for a whole
cheering section!</p>

<p>News of the Wyndham-Toll’s game didn’t reach the
school until just before supper time, but when it came
it was wonderful! Wyndham 33, Toll’s 6! The Dark
Blue had bettered Wolcott’s score by ten points! It had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
scored one more touchdown than Wolcott and been
scored against less! Wyndham went in to supper
in a joyous and rather noisy state. And later in the
evening, when the First came rolling up the driveway
in the two big busses that had taken them back and
forth over the road, it was given a welcome worthy
of a triumphant Cæsar.</p>

<p class="cap">In Loring’s room that Sunday morning the steam
radiator was hissing softly, perhaps at the chill,
damp current of air blowing in on it from the
partly opened window, the floor was liberally strewn
with pages, and sections of three Sunday papers and
three youths, one for each paper, sat or sprawled about
in lazy comfort. Wattles, just a trifle more proper and
solemn than on week-days, with his best dark suit on,
and his black derby immaculately brushed, had left a
moment before for the village, a prayer-book and
hymnal firmly clutched in one hand. Wattles always
left early for church, walked slowly, and with dignity,
and, having reached the small edifice at the far end of
the village, spent a pleasant quarter of an hour watching
the arrival of the other members of the congregation.
After his departure Tom rescued the comic supplement
from beside his chair, and gave it his attention.
So long as Wattles, redolent of sabbatical decorum,
had been there he had not had the courage to
show interest in it. He felt that Wattles would
strongly, if silently, disapprove; and since the incident
at Danbury Tom had entertained for Wattles a vast
respect. His enjoyment of the highly colored pages
was, though, speedily interrupted by Clif.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“Did you see what Yale did to the Army, Tom?”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t able to get over to New Haven.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you, really? Well, Yale piled up 31 to
Army’s 10.”</p>

<p>“I was just reading it,” said Loring, coming into
view from behind his paper. “Yale’s finally got a
winning team, I think.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you hear every year,” said Clif. “Then
it doesn’t come off! Still, she must be a heap better
this year to run up 31 against Army. Brown didn’t
do so badly, either.”</p>

<p>“What did she do?” inquired Tom innocently.
“Beat Vassar?”</p>

<p>“She beat St. Bonaventure, 19 to 0, and that’s—”</p>

<p>“Saint Who? What high school’s that, Clif?”</p>

<p>“Shut up! It’s the ‘high school’ that scored against
Cornell two or three weeks ago, and a team that can
do that—”</p>

<p>“Where do you get that stuff? Everybody scores on
Cornell. It’s quite the proper thing to do this year.
Colgate did it, and Williams, and now Dartmouth.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what was Cornell doing while Dartmouth
made a little old seven points?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was wondering,” replied Tom.
“Maybe she was having afternoon tea, eh?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” laughed Loring, “you chaps are
mightily interested in games that don’t mean much to
you. What about Wolcott’s showing against Riverside
Military? It doesn’t make our score against
Toll’s look so fine, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“I guess Riverside’s pretty weak,” said Tom.
“What’s she done this season, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about her,” answered Loring,
“but 41 to 0 is an awful score! It looks as if Wolcott
might still have an edge on us, Tom. What I don’t
understand, though, is about that fellow Grosfawk.
He played only part of the time yesterday, and nothing
is said about him. I thought he was Wolcott’s particular
wonder, and that they were building a bunch
of plays around him.”</p>

<p>“It is sort of queer,” said Tom. “The way they tell
it here, Grosfawk was the whole thing last year when
they played us. This year you don’t hear anything
about him.”</p>

<p>“He’s only a substitute, as I figure it,” remarked
Clif. “You see him getting in now and then, but
he’s never in the first line-up.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s strategy,” Tom offered. “Maybe they’re
trying to make us think he’s not much so we won’t
worry about him. Then they’ll start him, and he will
run rings around us, like last year.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose Mr. Otis knows what’s doing,”
said Loring. “Mr. Hilliard, and the fellows who went
over yesterday to see Wolcott play, have probably
brought back some dope.”</p>

<p>“‘Pinky’ is all right,” observed Tom, “but it seems
to me that ‘G. G.’ ought to have gone himself. By the
way, they say he didn’t come back to school.”</p>

<p>“Who, Pinky? I saw him at prayers this morning,”
said Clif.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>“No, you dumbbell, ‘G. G.’ Billy said he was feeling
rotten about the time the game was over, and they
stopped at a drug store afterwards and ‘G. G.’ got
dosed up there, and then went on home. Back to-morrow,
I suppose. Say, how badly was Fargo hurt?
Anyone know?”</p>

<p>“You hear all sorts of yarns,” said Clif. “Guy
Owens, the yellow haired fellow who helps manage,
said that Fargo would be laid up most of the week.
Then I heard that he got hurt in the same leg last
year, and that the doctor told him he oughtn’t to play
any more.”</p>

<p>“Imagine ‘Big Bill’ paying any attention to that,”
chuckled Tom. “Well, we won’t need him next Saturday,
I suppose. This High Point game is a cinch,
they say. Guess he will be right there on both feet the
week after!”</p>

<p>“From what I get about yesterday’s merry little
fracas, it was a regular humdinger,” said Clif. “I’d
like to have seen it. Toll’s roughed it up considerable.
One of her fellows was put out by the referee, they
say.”</p>

<p>“Sure it wasn’t the umpire?” asked Tom mildly.</p>

<p>“Well, umpire then. Anyway, our bunch got pretty
well bunged up. Raiford’s wearing plaster all over
his face to-day.”</p>

<p>“Must be an improvement,” said Tom. “I never
did like Raiford’s face.”</p>

<p>Mr. Otis was not back the next day when the First
got out for practice and Mr. Hilliard, his assistant, took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
charge. There was no scrimmage with the Scrub, for
the First, while it had run up a big score against its
adversary on Saturday, had found plenty of opposition,
and not a few of the players were nursing wounds.
“Big Bill” Fargo didn’t even put in an appearance, although
most of the temporary invalids sat on the bench
or, draped in their blankets, followed the drill. The
Scrub, left to its own devices, took up that new forward-pass
play and another, of Mr. Babcock’s devising,
and worked at them until they were running quite
smoothly. Of course, however, as Loring realized, the
forward-pass play couldn’t be fairly judged until it
had been tried out in actual playing. The opposition
put up by the Scrub Team substitutes, with “Cocky”
at left guard to make up the eleven, provided no real
test for the play.</p>

<p>That evening, after spending the whole afternoon
groaning and writhing in Number 34, Tom faced Mr.
Wyatt across that well-remembered desk and somehow
floundered through an examination. Mr. Wyatt displayed
no enthusiasm over the performance, but he
did say, somewhat wearily, at the end: “All right,
Kemble. I haven’t the heart to say what I ought
to. Please go before I give way to unmanly emotion!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Tom. “Thanks!”</p>

<p>Deserted by his chums—for Clif, too, had failed to
show up after supper—Loring sat in his chair with the
chess-board before him. He had started to work out
a problem, but had not got far with it. Another problem,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
having nothing to do with chess, had substituted
itself, and for a long while Loring sat and tapped the
black queen against the edge of the board, and stared
intently at nothing. Then, he set the board aside and
propelled the chair across to the door and through it,
and made his slow way around to West Hall. “Babe”
Ridgway happened along and pushed him the last part
of his journey, depositing him by request in the reading
room. Loring was seeking something he was not
at all certain existed in the reading room, and it took
him several minutes, and much dexterous filling and
backing between chairs and tables and shelves—fortunately
the room was not well occupied—to discover
that it did exist. Having secured it, he made out a
slip with the date and his name, and put it in the clip
beside the wide, shallow shelf. Then, with the issues
of the daily paper published at the nearest metropolis
of the state from the middle of September to last Saturday
in front of him, he returned to his room. To
his right as he left the reading room, beyond the library,
a considerable throng of fellows were congregated
around the recreation room doorway, and some subject
of more than ordinary interest appeared to engross
them, for every one seemed to be talking at once
and there was quite an atmosphere of excitement down
there. But, although mildly curious, Loring preferred
not to venture into the crowd with his chair, and so
made his way back to East Hall. Once there, he devoted
the rest of the time before study hour, and much
time thereafter to a careful and thoughtful perusal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
of the many papers he had brought back with him;
or, to be more exact, to certain items in those
papers.</p>

<p>Tom, coming downstairs after that enervating experience
in Mr. Wyatt’s study, saw the crowd at the
end of the corridor, and joined it as fast as he could.
An acquaintance named Bumstead, a slight, sandy
haired youth, who wore big, round spectacles, and
whom Tom disliked cordially, presented himself as the
nearest source of information. Bumstead turned incredulous,
but joyous eyes on the inquirer.</p>

<p>“Say, haven’t you heard?” he exclaimed almost
shrilly. “Gee, where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Picking daisies,” replied Tom impatiently. “Spill
it!”</p>

<p>“Otis is sick, and can’t come back the rest of the
season! He’s got the ‘flu’! They just got word from
him.”</p>

<p>“Roll your hoop!” said Tom incredulously. “Who
says so?”</p>

<p>“Gee, it’s true! Ask any one. Faculty’s called a
meeting of the Athletic Committee, too. This evening.
In ‘Pinky’s’ room. Ask any one.”</p>

<p>“If ‘G. G.’s’ so blamed sick how could he write and
tell about it?” demanded Tom witheringly. “Of
course, I’m not saying he hasn’t got the ‘flu’; lots of
folks have it; but it’s crazy to say he isn’t coming
back.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he didn’t write himself,” said Bumstead.
“Maybe it was the doctor or some one. Anyway—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>But Tom had caught sight of Joe Whitemill, of the
First Team, and he plowed his way through to him.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about, Whitemill?” he asked anxiously.
“Is ‘G. G.’ really out of it?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, hello, Kemble. Yes, that’s the way we
get it. He’s down with influenza, and the doctor says
he won’t be able to do any more coaching this season.
I don’t know where the story came from, though.
Every one has it, but no one knows where it started.
For my part—”</p>

<p>“It’s straight goods,” interrupted Jimmy Ames, appearing
at Tom’s side. “Mr. Connover told Dave
Lothrop and Dave spilled it a few minutes ago. Faculty’s
sent word to the Committee to get busy, and
there’s going to be a meeting in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“But, Great Heck!” exclaimed Tom. “What—what—why,
that’ll play the very dickens, won’t it?”</p>

<p>Whitemill grinned, but the grin held no humor.
“Oh, no, not at all! Swapping coaches ten days before
the big game is a mere trifle, Kemble. It’s easy when
you—”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any swapping,” predicted Jimmy.
“Where’d we get a new coach now? Anyway, he
wouldn’t know the team, and he’d be worse than none.
‘Pinky’ will take Otis’s place, of course.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Tom. “Well—but, heck, fellows,
it’s going to make a difference! How does ‘Pinky’
know what Otis was going to do? Or does he know?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” said Whitemill despondently. “I suppose
they’ve talked things over a good deal, though.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
Anyway, we’ll pull through somehow. Hang it, we’ll
beat that bunch without any coach at all if we have
to!”</p>

<p>“Spoken like a hero!” commented Jimmy Ames.
“Just the same, if I had anything up on the Wolcott
game I’d begin to hedge just about now, old dear.
Say, Dave’s fit to be tied, fellows. He was talking
about canceling the game, and all that stuff a few minutes
ago up in ‘Swede’s’ room.”</p>

<p>“Cancel the game!” growled Whitemill. “I’ll say
not! That would be a swell thing to do! Gosh, I’d
rather get licked to smithereens than not play at all!
Besides, why, thunder, Jimmy, you can’t crawl out of
a game just because you’ve lost your coach! What’s
the matter with Dave, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was just getting rid of some of his peeve,
I suppose,” said Jimmy. “Just talking to relieve his
mind. I don’t blame him, though, for being a mite
upset. Gosh, he’s captain, and if this thing’s as bad
as they say it is—”</p>

<p>“There’s the gong,” broke in Tom. “A grand lot
of studying we’ll do to-night! Say, where’s ‘Pinky’?
Any one seen him? Why doesn’t some one ask him
what the real facts are?”</p>

<p>“You do it,” suggested Whitemill. “He’s probably
in just the right temper to answer fool questions.”</p>

<p>“Fool questions be blowed!” called Tom after the
halfback’s retreating form. “How come we fellows
haven’t some right to know what’s going on, you big
cheese?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“Just what is it you’d like to know?” inquired a
voice at Tom’s back. Tom, startled, turned to find Mr.
Hilliard facing him soberly from the foot of the
stairs. Tom swallowed. Then, conscious of the sudden
silence that had fallen about him, he recovered his
assurance.</p>

<p>“About Mr. Otis, sir,” he answered. “They say he’s
sick and won’t be able to come back all season. I—we’d
like to know if that’s true.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, Kemble,” replied “Pinky” gravely.
“Mr. Otis has contracted influenza, and, so his doctor
writes us, is a very sick man. Even if he recovers
within the customary time he will not be in condition
to continue his work here with the Team. It is a
very unfortunate happening, both for Mr. Otis and
for the School, but we must all make the best of it.
The gong has rung, fellows.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<small>“COCKY” MAKES A CALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">During the rest of that evening, and most
of the following day a new rumor was to be
met at every corner. Excitement was followed
by consternation as the school came to a fuller
realization of the gravity of the catastrophe. A new
coach could be found to direct the Team’s course for
the rest of the way, but he would be handicapped from
the start by a lack of knowledge both of the men he
was to handle, and of the foundation already constructed
by his predecessor. He might, too, fail to
command the confidence of the players. The report
that Mr. Hilliard was to take charge met with little
enthusiasm. “Pinky” doubtless possessed the advantage
of Mr. Otis’s confidence, and he knew the ground,
but few of the First Team credited him with the qualities
required of a successful coach. Oddly enough, the
solution of the quandary arrived at by the Athletic
Committee Tuesday occurred to few beforehand. The
Committee’s decision was awaited impatiently. The
rumored meeting did not take place Monday evening,
and until after dinner on Tuesday the school had to
be satisfied with speculation. Then, at last, the news
was out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Babcock would succeed Mr. Otis as First Team
Coach. Mr. Hilliard would continue as Assistant
Coach. Mr. Connover would take over the Second
Team.</p>

<p>Wyndham School blinked its eyes and wondered
why it hadn’t thought of “Cocky”! Why, “Cocky”
was just the ticket! Oh, anyhow, he was lots better
than a stranger who wouldn’t know anything about
anything! On the whole, the decision met with hearty
approval. Even those who knew little of the practical
side of football, but had encountered Mr. Babcock in
his rôle of Physical Director felt certain that he possessed
to a degree the stern, disciplinary qualities associated
by them with the gridiron martinet. Those
who had ever really tried Mr. Babcock’s patience during
gymnasium instruction gave it as their studied
opinion that “‘Cocky’ was a hard-boiled egg, and
ought to make a corking coach for the First!” Perhaps
there were some on the First who didn’t wholly
approve of the Football Committee’s selection, but they
were few in number and were not talking for publication.
It remained for the Scrub Team to utter the
only disapproving note. Scrub protested loudly that
it wouldn’t stand for it! What was the idea, snatching
its coach like that? Didn’t it have any rights? And
what in the dickens did “Steve” Connover, the baseball
coach, know about football? What was to become
of the Scrub Team, anyway?</p>

<p>This, of course, was a selfish view of affairs, one
which took no thought of “the greatest good to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
greatest number” and all that sort of thing, and so it
found little sympathy. And after its first burst of
indignation the Scrub relapsed into grumbles and accepted
the inevitable—and “Steve.” “Steve” was
rather a surprise, too. He proved in short order that,
while he might be a specialist in baseball, and not
know everything there was to know about the gridiron
game, he was quite competent to see the Scrub Team
through the rest of its season. And he made rather a
hit with the fellows at the outset by not “pulling a
line of guff,” as “Wink” Coles elegantly expressed it,
about being unfamiliar with the duties and relying on
them all to help him. No, “Steve” didn’t ask any assistance.
He just took hold on Tuesday afternoon at
twenty minutes to four, and gave each and every one a
good, hard “six licks at the dummy,” not hesitating to
tell them how rotten they were—most of them—nor
being at a loss for improving instructions. They resented
his criticism more because it seemed to reflect
on “Cocky” than for more personal reasons, but they
didn’t harbor resentment long. “Steve” kept them too
busy, maybe. They trotted over and tried to take a
fall out of the First at four-thirty, and didn’t do so
badly, for the First still lacked the services of Fargo,
and one or two other lesser lights, and, besides, appeared
to be suffering slightly from unsettled nerves.
The Scrub sent Johnny Thayer across the big team’s
goal in the second half of the game, and was scored
on thrice by the opponent.</p>

<p>Fargo sat on the bench, his left knee enormously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
bandaged and padded, and scowled darkly on the world.
Report had it that the fullback would be all ready to
play in Saturday’s game if needed. As Saturday’s contest,
the next to the last on the Wyndham schedule,
was with High Point School, he very likely would not
be needed, for High Point was not a strong aggregation,
and had been selected for that reason. To-day
“Swede” Hanbury worked at fullback most of the
time, being relieved by Massingham and Badger toward
the last. There was not much choice evident, although
Hanbury possessed the advantage over his competitors
of being a good kicker. Scrub, still resentful over the
loss of its coach, and reminded of the fact by the sight
of “Cocky” devoting his energies to the First, played
a bit more savagely this afternoon and neither asked
nor gave mercy. But the First was undoubtedly suffering
from an inferiority complex and offered almost
nothing in the way of reprisal. Al Greene and Billy
Desmond, between whom a friendly feud had existed
all season, ended the game with the honors all Al’s for
the first time.</p>

<p>It was Billy who, in response to Tom’s thirst for
information, voiced the verdict of the First Wednesday
evening. “Why,” said Billy in the privacy of
Number 34, accommodating his body with muffled
groans to the peculiarities of the couch, “‘Cocky’s’ all
right, Tom. He goes at it differently from Otis, but he
seems to know what he’s doing and why he’s doing it.
And he doesn’t mind you knowing, either. You see,
‘G. G.’ never would let any one in on his plans. ‘G. G.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
was the Big Cheese, and you weren’t supposed to ask
questions or want to know how come. Now ‘Cocky’
lets every one in on things. Maybe it doesn’t make
us play any better, but it lets us think we’re more than
just so many machines without anything above the
boilers! He’s having us up in the rowing room before
practice to talk things over. Of course, he does most
of the talking—he and Dave, and sometimes Stoddard—but
we like it.”</p>

<p>“You’d better,” said Tom. “‘Cocky’s’ a grand
coach, and a sight better than you guys deserve. Heck,
he knows more real inside football than ‘G. G.’ ever
thought of!”</p>

<p>“Quit your kidding,” growled Billy. “He’s all right,
just as I told you, but he isn’t the coach ‘G. G.’ is.
And any one casting asparagus on ‘G. G.’ will have me
on his neck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he’s all right,” acknowledged Tom. “Say,
what do they hear about him, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Otis? Nothing except that he’s getting along all
right so far. I guess he’s just got a thundering fine
case of the ‘flu,’ and you can be beastly sick with it, and
not worry your doc a mite. I know. I had it.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Babcock went to the First Team he took
Loring’s play with him, and on Wednesday evening
he dropped in at Loring’s room after supper and told
him so. “It’s promising,” he declared, “and I mean
to make use of it, Deane, if I can get the fellows to
make it go as it should. It’s got to be pulled off at the
right moment, under the right conditions.” He went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
quite exhaustively into that. “And,” he continued,
“it’s like any play in which so many are involved: you
can’t blunder it. If every man isn’t just where he
should be at the proper instant it will fizzle badly.
I’m not going to try it against High Point because, if
it is a find, I want to spring it fresh against Wolcott.
And Wolcott may have some one looking on here Saturday;
looking for us to try out some eleventh hour
stunt like that. I’ve told the Scrub to keep away from
it. Jackson wanted to use it next Saturday against
the Wolcott Scrub, but that wouldn’t do.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Babcock,” asked Loring, “do you know why
Wolcott hasn’t used Grosfawk more this season?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. That’s puzzled me a little, too. I
haven’t seen his name more than twice all the fall, and
last year he looked like a real find. I presume Mr.
Otis had some information on Grosfawk, but I don’t
know a thing. Anyhow, we’ve laid our lines for that
chap, and he will be watched pretty closely. But Wolcott
hasn’t showed much in the overhead game so far,
and maybe she’s intending to use it only as a last
resort.”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t shown it in public, sir,” said Loring,
“but she’s practiced forward-passing ever since she
started work.”</p>

<p>Mr. Babcock looked interested. “Is that so? How
did you learn that, Deane?”</p>

<p>Loring indicated a binder filled with newspapers that
lay on a chair nearby. “I’ve been reading the Wolcott
football stuff in the papers, sir. Their correspondent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
is pretty close-mouthed, but he lets something out now
and then. I’ve been all through the papers from the
seventeenth of September to yesterday, and I’ve learned
two or three rather interesting things, Mr. Babcock.
One is that Wolcott’s been using the forward-pass in
practice, although in outside games she’s made only
about fourteen passes in all, an average of a little over
two to a game. But the important thing, sir, is that
out of those fourteen ten were successful. That’s an
unusual average, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly! What were they, Deane, long or
short?”</p>

<p>“Both, apparently. I couldn’t always make out which
they were. But they went all right in nearly every
case, and that’s something to think about, Mr. Babcock.”</p>

<p>“It’s something to think a whole lot about,” was the
answer. “Did Grosfawk figure in any of those plays?”</p>

<p>“Not one, sir.”</p>

<p>“Cocky” stared thoughtfully at Loring and Loring
looked thoughtfully back at him. Finally: “Hm,” said
the instructor. “What do you make of that? Do you
suppose Grosfawk petered out this year? He’s rather
a youngster, I believe, and it may be he couldn’t find
himself.”</p>

<p>“What I think, sir, is that he got hurt, hurt badly
enough to keep him from hard work.” Loring took a
slip of paper from his leather wallet. “Grosfawk’s
name appears eight times in the stories written for
the paper by the Wolcott correspondent up to October<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
Fifth. After that it doesn’t appear at all. The Fifth
of October was Friday, and Wolcott played Nelson
the next day. Wolcott won by 23 to 6, or something
like that. It was a slow game and Wolcott used a
whole string of substitutes in the last half. But she
didn’t use Grosfawk. Grosfawk was spoken of in the
paper as having taken part in practice on Thursday.
Now I think something happened either Thursday or
Friday. Either he got hurt or he got in wrong with
the faculty over studies. Up to that Fifth of October,
the fellow who writes the stuff for the paper was
always mentioning him. Once he spoke of him as
‘Wolcott’s spectacular end,’ and another time as ‘the
speedy runner who grabbed last year’s game from
Wyndham,’ or something like that. Then he drops
him entirely!”</p>

<p>“All that is food for thought,” replied Mr. Babcock,
smiling. “I dare say that you’ve figured it correctly,
Deane, but, just for the sake of argument, what about
this theory? Suppose they’ve kept on using Grosfawk
in practice and have carefully kept his name out of the
papers with the idea of letting us think he isn’t to be
bothered about. You know he <em>has</em> played occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Mighty little, sir. Maybe five times, and then only
for a few minutes, probably.”</p>

<p>“Still—”</p>

<p>“Besides, sir,” interrupted Loring eagerly, “if Wolcott
wanted us to think that Grosfawk was—was eliminated
she would have used more certain methods, don’t
you think? Wouldn’t she have let the report get out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
that he had been injured or that he was in Dutch with
the Office or—or something? See what I mean, sir?
She couldn’t be certain that we’d notice his not playing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, probably she would have,” acknowledged the
other. “Well, granting your idea’s the right one,
Deane, who do you take it is to get Grosfawk’s job at
catching passes and getting off with them? Or who
has got it already?”</p>

<p>Loring shook his head. “That’s what I can’t make
out, sir. They’ve been building up a forward-passing
game in secret, but the reports from there don’t actually
say so. You’ve got to read between the lines. In the
outside games five players have taken passes, and only
one of them, Loomis, is mentioned more than the
others. Loomis is their regular left end. He was on
their team last year, and fellows I’ve talked with say
he wasn’t much of a player.”</p>

<p>Mr. Babcock was silent for a long moment. Then
he asked briskly: “Think you could get to Cotterville
next Saturday, Deane?”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“Me, sir!” Loring looked startled.</p>

<p>“I suppose you couldn’t. I forgot for
the moment that you can’t get about as
easily as the rest of us. It only occurred to me that,
knowing what you do already, Deane, you’d be just
the fellow. But never mind. I’ll find some one.”</p>

<p>“Why, I could go, Mr. Babcock,” said Loring
eagerly. “It—it sort of surprised me, that was all.
And I’m not sure that I could do what you’d want, sir.”</p>

<p>“I think you could. You see, I don’t want a report
on the playing. I just want you to look around over
there and see what goes on. There may be a nigger
in the wood-pile, or there may not. If there is, you
may not spot him, but it’s worth trying; and you’re
the man for the job since you know the situation better
than any of us. See who they use as substitutes and
try to figure out why. If your hunch is the right one,
Deane, they’ve got an end or a back over there that
they’ve been keeping under cover. Look for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It’s sort of like spying, though, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“We call it scouting. It’s quite legitimate. They do
it, and we do it, just as all the schools and colleges do,
and they’ll expect us to have scouts there to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
just as we expect them to have scouts here. In fact,
I think I’d tell them that you’re from Wyndham.
Maybe they’ll get you a good place to see from.”</p>

<p>“That’s one difficulty,” said Loring. “I’ll have to
go over by automobile, and I suppose I couldn’t get
near enough to see much without getting out.”</p>

<p>“Unless they’ve changed their arrangements there,”
replied the instructor, “you are allowed to park on one
side of the field, and if you got there early enough you
could pretty near have your choice. I’ll see about a
car—”</p>

<p>“No, please, sir! Wattles will attend to that. I’d a
great deal rather not have you or any one pay for anything,
Mr. Babcock.”</p>

<p>“But, Deane, the Athletic Association is perfectly
able to stand the expense, and it’s only fair that it
should. An automobile will cost twenty dollars or so,
I imagine, and there’s no reason why you should pay it.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather, if you don’t mind, sir,” Loring persisted.</p>

<p>“Well, suit yourself. I’ll see you again on Friday
and we’ll talk it over before you go. By the way, you’d
better have some one with you, hadn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take Wattles, sir. Good night, and thanks for
bothering with that play.”</p>

<p>“If it works as I hope it’s going to, Deane, thanks
will be going the other way. Good night.”</p>

<p>The second cheer meeting—there had been one on
the eve of the Toll’s game—was held Thursday after
study hour, and some new songs were tried out—Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
Parks at the piano—and some old ones were resung.
And, of course, there was a good deal of enthusiasm
and noise. There was another and even more demonstrative
affair Saturday evening, at which Mr. Babcock
and Mr. Clendenin, who was Chairman of the Athletic
Committee, and Captain Dave spoke, but before that
other events transpired.</p>

<p>The Scrub got badly mauled on Thursday, for the
First Team, recovering its self-esteem and poise, went
after revenge. Yet the Fighting Scrub proved once
again its right to the nickname and the nine points
scored by the adversary were hard earned. Loring’s
forward-pass play—known now as Number 30—was
twice used by the First, the second time for a long gain
that led to the field-goal. This in spite of the fact that
the Scrub knew the play and was watching for it.
Friday was another hard day, for “Cocky” was driving
the team with Wolcott in mind and making no preparations
for the next day’s visitors. There was only
one period of scrimmaging, but it lasted fifteen minutes
and held at least one spectacular incident. That was
Clif’s interception of Ogden’s forward-pass. Ogden,
a second-string half, was being tried out at fullback
and was making a good impression. Ogden, while not
so heavy as Hanbury or Badger, still had a good deal
of weight and wore it where it did the most good when
he hit the Scrub line. And Ogden was faster than any
of the other candidates for the position of alternate
to “Big Bill.” That pass was made from kicking position
after the First had hammered its way to the Scrub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
twenty-seven and two slams at the line had yielded but
four yards. It was a quick, short heave over right
tackle and was meant for Stiles or Archer, the latter
having lately displaced Couch at left end, but Clif had
swept around back of his line with the snapping of the
ball, for “Wink” Coles had “called” the play, and it
was Clif, and neither Whitemill nor Archer who was
on the spot when the pass went over. Clif made the
catch while still going at brisk speed and he kept on
going, heading first for the side-line and then turning
in. Since the First Team left end and right half were
already out of the way, he had only Stoddard and
Ogden to challenge him at first. But by the time he
was well straightened out, running some five yards inside
the border, Cotter, First’s speedy left tackle, had
taken up the chase. Cotter soon distanced the others,
and it was he who finally threw Clif out of bounds at
the First’s thirty-eight. That the Scrub only got five
yards more in three downs spoke well for the big team’s
defense. “Sim” Jackson’s toss to Adams grounded
and First took the pigskin. But Clif had covered some
forty-eight yards in that romp of his, and, back in the
gymnasium, once more enjoyed the applause of his
teammates.</p>

<p>There were two games played on Wyndham Field
on Saturday. At two o’clock the Wyndham and Wolcott
Scrub Teams met and, since the High Point contest
was not to begin until three, the School surrounded
the farther gridiron and cheered lustily for the Scrub.
When it was obliged to leave in order to be present at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
the kick-off of the more important contest the score
was 7 to 7, the third period was a minute or two old
and it was anybody’s game. There were some staunch
supporters, however, who remained until the last, and
they were well repaid, for it was the final fifteen minutes
that held the real thrills.</p>

<p>Both Wyndham and Wolcott were reduced to line-ups
largely composed of substitutes by that time, for
the game had been a hard-fought and not over gentle
affair. Although they were but Second Teams and no
championship depended on their efforts, they were still
Wyndham and Wolcott, rivals always. Each team
played not for its own honor but for the honor of its
School, and mighty deeds were performed before the
question of supremacy was settled. At 7 to 7 the
battle had waged into the third period and through it,
and at 7 to 7 the last quarter had started. Then, when
some three minutes had gone by, Wolcott’s brown-stockinged
horde swept into its stride and, strengthened
by the return of several first-string men who had been
deposed in the first half, slammed its way down to the
home team’s twenty-five-yard line. There the ball was
lost only to be recovered again. From the thirty-two
Wolcott started once more and tore forward. “Babe”
Ridgway, who had stuck it out under a grueling
attack through three busy periods, had to give way
finally to Pat Tyson, and Pat was responsible for an
advance that took Wolcott from the twenty-eight to
the sixteen yards. Wyndham steadied then and held,
momentarily, but when the enemy had reached the ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
yards it was not to be denied, and at last, when two
smashes at the center had netted but three, the Wolcott
right half took the ball on a cross-buck and plunged
inside Jimmy Ames for a first down. Three more
plays put the pigskin across.</p>

<p>The period was fully half over and those six points
looked enough to spell victory for the visitor, but the
Fighting Scrub couldn’t spell that way. Scrub set
itself to dispute the try-for-point, and when Al Greene
strode over the sprawling body of his adversary and
plunged toward the kicker that youth hurried his effort.
The ball didn’t miss the goal by many inches, but miss
it did, and the Fighting Scrub gave voice to joy and
stumbled back to positions. Mr. Connover shuffled his
men then. Tyson crossed over to right tackle and
“Wink” Coles went to center. Hoppin replaced Thayer
and Patch took Clif’s place. And with that final change
“Steve” shot his last bolt. He hadn’t a single available
player left to call on! But Wolcott didn’t know that.</p>

<p>Wyndham’s chance didn’t come along until the period
was twelve minutes old. Then desperate, but still believing
in its ability to even the score, “Sim” Jackson,
who had spent the third quarter on the bench, dug
deeply into his small bag of tricks and, finding nothing
much there, used what was left. It wasn’t much of a
trick, either, but it served. The Fighting Scrub tore
itself literally in half and the two halves hugged the
side-lines. The ball went with the left portion of the
team. Wolcott moved this way and that, momentarily
at a loss how to meet the extraordinary formation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
That wide-open space in the middle of the field held
a strong attraction for the visitor, and, although it
finally divided its defense just as Wyndham had divided
its attack, it was evident that the opening was much
on its mind. The handful of Wolcott adherents and
players on the side-line howled derision. Then “Wink”
passed the ball at an angle to Heard, a back across the
field started with the ball and ran toward his own goal,
and Wolcott became loudly vocal with warnings and
advice and swarmed in the direction of the ball. Heard
stepped back and back, facing the middle of the field.
Then, when further delay meant danger, he swung half
about and threw the ball to his left. Jeff Adams, who
had skirted around close to the side-line and was now
well away, put up a pair of long arms and a pair of
large, eager hands and plucked the ball out of the air.
After that, very soon after, he set out for Wolcott’s
goal as though he had important business somewhere
in its vicinity!</p>

<p>But, although Jeff had a fair start, he wasn’t swift
enough to cover fifty-odd yards before the enemy overtook
him. He did consume thirty-three or possibly
thirty-four, however, and when a fleet-footed, brown-legged
enemy banged him vindictively to earth he was
on Wolcott’s twenty-one! That bang was temporarily
too much for Jeff and time was called while he was
induced to put some air back into his lungs. Then,
with the few Wyndham rooters that were present
dancing about and waving sweaters and howling ecstatically,
the Fighting Scrub returned to its struggle. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
was fighting now not only against Wolcott but against
time, for the final whistle wasn’t far off. Every one
knows that you can’t use a trick play like that “split
team” twice in succession and get away with it. Sim
Jackson knew it. So he tried it again!</p>

<p>That is, he split the team as before, while Wolcott
showed amazement plainly. The fool thing was a
crazy quarterback trying it close to the twenty! Well,
they knew what to expect this time and so, while their
forwards watched their men their backs arranged themselves
for a forward-pass. This time, naturally, Wolcott
didn’t waste three men to look after three of the
enemy who were almost the width of the field from
the ball. Wolcott put its strength where the danger
lay. Which was a fortunate thing for Wolcott, since
no forward-pass was attempted and Hoppin, who carried
the ball, would have gained much more than seven
yards had the opponent divided its forward line evenly.
But even seven yards is not to be sneezed at when it
lays the ball close to the thirteen!</p>

<p>Wyndham closed up then and played rational football,
and, with something under forty seconds left,
cleared the goal-line in three plunges, beating the whistle
by the tick of the watch. That touchdown—credit it
to Stiles—tied the score, and when Lee Heard, plainly
nervous, stepped far back to take the pass from “Wink”
you could have heard a pin drop. Well, not just that,
perhaps, for a pin doesn’t make much sound when it
strikes a football field, I suppose, and there was a good
deal of noise from the First Team gridiron; but things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
were awfully quiet just then. Even the Wolcott players,
prancing and edging, madly anxious to break
through, said nothing! Then, when Heard had trod
around for a moment back there, he held his arms out
straight and—oh, well, he made the goal. There’s no
use in prolonging suspense. Wyndham won the game,
completing her season with three victories, and a score
or so of tired, dirt-stained boys hugged each other
weakly and cheered the defeated rival.</p>

<p>Later, Clif and the others, refreshed and hurriedly
rehabilitated, reached the other field in time to see the
First play the final quarter of its game with High
Point. It wasn’t very interesting, and even if it had
been the Scrub players were still too excited over their
own triumph to find it so. Ostensibly they watched
the First Team substitutes vainly try to add to the Dark
Blue’s score of 14 to 0, but actually they saw little that
went on. They were going over the Wolcott Scrub
contest almost play by play and deriving a soul-satisfying
pleasure. The Fighting Scrub, however others
might appraise it, thought very well of itself that Saturday
afternoon!</p>

<small>THE SCRUB DISBANDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Neither Clif nor Tom had more than a
glimpse of Loring until late Sunday afternoon.
Then Wattles found them both in
Tom’s room and announced that Loring would like to
see them in front of East Hall.</p>

<p>“Have his folks gone, Wattles?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“No, sir, not yet. I think Mister Loring wishes you
to meet them, sir.”</p>

<p>Tom exchanged glances with Clif and then grabbed
his brushes and smoothed his hair into place. “We’ll
be right down, Wattles,” he said. Wattles departed
and Clif seized the brushes that Tom had abandoned
in favor of a whisk. Finally, a trifle awed, they set
forth. But neither Mr. Deane nor Mrs. Deane proved
formidable. Loring’s father was a tall, rather thin
gentleman with a closely cropped gray mustache and
pink cheeks, who looked more like an army man than
the popular conception of a multimillionaire. He had
a way of half closing his eyes when he smiled that
was most engaging. Loring looked more like his
mother, who, as Tom enthusiastically confided to Clif
later, was “a pippin.” They were still in the handsome
big car that had aroused Clif’s admiration several weeks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
before, and Loring sat between them. They had been
to the shore for luncheon, Loring explained, and—</p>

<p>“Lobster,” said Mr. Deane, squinting his eyes in his
funny way and sighing. “They were good, weren’t
they, Lory? Um-m!”</p>

<p>“My dear,” chided Mrs. Deane, “do you think it’s
kind to gloat over lobster before Clif and Tom? You
don’t mind if I call you Clif, do you?” She smiled
apologetically on Tom. “Loring speaks so often of
you, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” stammered Tom.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Clif does, though,” laughed Loring.
“You’ve got them mixed, mother.”</p>

<p>“Have I? Well, that’s your fault, Loring. Your
introduction was so sketchy! Which of you is it who
plays football so nicely?”</p>

<p>“Both of us, Mrs. Deane,” replied Clif daringly.
“But I’m the one you had in mind.”</p>

<p>“Huh-huh,” chuckled Mr. Deane appreciatively.
Mrs. Deane dimpled and then sighed.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re making fun of me. Anyway,
you’re both gorgeous looking boys, and I like you both
for being so nice to my boy. And I’m coming up next
Saturday—it is Saturday, isn’t it?—to see you play.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will,” said Tom intensely. “We won’t
be playing, but it’s going to be a corking game, Mrs.
Deane.”</p>

<p>“But I want to see <em>you</em> play,” she demurred. “And
you.” She included Clif in her glance. “Perhaps, just
as a favor to me, you will, won’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>Tom’s mouth opened, but he didn’t seem to be able
to find anything to say. Then his eyes, wandering
from Mrs. Deane, encountered Loring’s grin and he
got very red and made a choking sound. Clif came
to his rescue. “We’ll do our best,” he laughed. “You
see, we’re only on the Scrub Team, Mrs. Deane, and
it’s the First Team that plays Wolcott. I hope you
will come, too, sir.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Loring’s father. “Well, now, I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would, dad,” begged Loring.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see, Lory. It seems to me, though, I’ve
got something on Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Not a thing but a game of golf,” said Mrs. Deane,
“and if Loring wants you to come—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my dear! Of course!” He winked slyly
at Clif. “I dare say it will rain Saturday, anyway.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be the first time you’d golfed in the
rain,” responded his wife severely. “But next Saturday,
rain or shine, you are coming up here with me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” he chuckled, “I’m sure I am. Boys,
take the advice of a wise old man and don’t marry a
tyrannical wife!”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Tom promptly and earnestly.
Whereat every one laughed and Wattles lifted Loring
out and the big car rolled away.</p>

<p>Eager to hear what Loring had learned at Cotterville
the day before, Clif and Tom hurried over to his
room after supper. But only Wattles was there.
Mister Loring, he explained, was visiting Mr. Babcock.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
Wattles’s tone was rather impressive. Since that visit
to Wolcott yesterday he had carried himself with added
dignity, for was not he, too, concerned in matters of
deep moment? Had he not taken a part, though a
humble one, in diplomatic affairs? Always a model
of discretion, to-night Wattles was discreeter than
ever, and when Tom asked: “Did he find out anything,
Wattles?” he glanced toward windows and doors before,
lowering his voice to a confidential murmur, he
answered: “Yes, sir. Something extremely important,
Mister Kemble, but I am not at liberty to mention it,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, roll your hoop,” grumbled Tom. “I guess he
will tell us, all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” agreed Wattles. “Quite so, sir.”</p>

<p>But they didn’t learn very much from Loring, after
all, for “Cocky” had advised against it. He did tell
them about the journey to Cotterville, in the same
antiquated but efficient vehicle that had brought Tom
back from Danbury, and how Wattles, learning something
of the mission, had advised stopping en route
and securing disguises, Wattles favoring for himself a
voluminous beard. But as to what he had actually
observed at the Wolcott game Loring was vague and
reticent. Tom got a trifle huffy and said he guessed
Loring hadn’t found out anything much, anyway, if
you asked <em>him</em>!</p>

<p>Monday morning Mr. Wyatt detained Tom after
class and said: “At my suggestion, Kemble, the Faculty
has released you from restrictions.” If he had expected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Tom to exhibit delight he was disappointed. Tom said
“Thank you, sir,” in a listless voice and looked a trifle
bored.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said the instructor, “the news hasn’t displeased
you?”</p>

<p>“Sir?” Tom viewed him questioningly. “Oh, no,
sir.” Then, recollecting that the removal of restrictions
would enable him to see the Wolcott game, he
added with a touch of animation: “It’s great, Mr.
Wyatt. I thought, maybe, I wouldn’t get to Cotterville
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“I see. And, of course, you can play football again,
Kemble.”</p>

<p>“Not much use, sir. The team gets through Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“Gets through? To be sure. So it does. Hm. I’d
forgotten that.” Mr. Wyatt looked so puzzled that
Tom wondered. Tom didn’t know, of course, that Mr.
Babcock had dropped in on “Alick” last evening and
that his, Tom’s, affairs had come up for discussion;
nor that Mr. Wyatt’s puzzlement had to do with
“Cocky’s” efforts to secure the removal of restrictions
from a boy whose football usefulness was practically
at an end! “Well,” continued the instructor, “I trust
that hereafter—er—we shall not have to—” His
thoughts returned to Mr. Babcock— “Hm, that will
be all, Kemble.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Tom, glad of release.</p>

<p>Coincidences do sometimes happen outside of fiction.
Less than thirty seconds later, having reached the foot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
of the stairway, Tom almost collided with a hurrying
figure.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Mr. Babcock. “Almost had—is that
Kemble?” He stopped abruptly in his long stride.
“Look here, are you square with the Office?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! Report to me this afternoon then.”</p>

<p>“You mean—” Tom swallowed. “Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“Come ready to play, Kemble.” “Cocky’s” voice
came back from well down the corridor. “May be able
to use you, young fellow!”</p>

<p>Well, things were happening strangely these days,
thought Tom!</p>

<p>They went on happening that way at intervals, too.
Tom joined the First Team squad on Monday. On
Tuesday he played left half against his former companions
of the Scrub, putting in almost as much time
at that job as did Whitemill and getting off the one
long forward-pass that secured any ground for the
First. What it all meant Tom could guess as little as
any one, with the probable exceptions of “Cocky” and
Captain Dave. But the cat was out of the bag on
Wednesday, and the heavens fell. I realize that the
metaphors don’t belong together, but each is satisfyingly
apt.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the truth about “Big Bill” Fargo
became known. He had been sent home Saturday on
the advice of the school physician and now he was
stretched out flat in some hospital with one knee entirely
surrounded by plaster of Paris! Oh, he would be back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
in a week or two, but there wouldn’t be any more football
or basketball or hockey for “Big Bill” this winter.
The fact that he would be back in a fortnight or less
interested the School not a particle just then. Later it
would consider that fact with gratification, but just
now all that occupied its mind was that the Team had
lost its best fullback in years, the one player who never
got hurt, the man around whom the Team’s attack
had been carefully constructed! So when I say that
the heavens fell I’m choosing my metaphor very carefully.</p>

<p>Until then Wyndham had still hoped to defeat her
rival. The loss of Coach Otis had been a severe blow,
but victory had remained a possibility in the judgment
of most. But now—why, it wasn’t worth talking
about! That game was as good as played! Might
just as well cheer Wolcott to-day and have it over with!</p>

<p>There were some who advocated forfeiting the game
while there was still time, but this idea didn’t meet
with general approval, not even while the stunning effect
of the blow was yet at its height. No, they’d play
Wolcott and do the best they could. That was only
sportsmanly. And maybe the poor, decrepit old Team
would crawl out of the contest still recognizable to its
closest friends! In any case, defeat was honorable if
not desirable!</p>

<p>There was a good deal of talk during Wednesday
and Thursday about Honor in Defeat, and the Last
Ditch, and Going Through With It. Wednesday
night’s mass meeting was truly pathetic. “Shadowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
Walls” sounded like a dirge when it was sung, and
“Win! Win! Wyndham,” for all of its volume, was
less a cheer than an intoned elegy. It suggested renunciation
but not defiance. Mr. Babcock’s gravely cheerful
remarks were applauded politely. The School appreciated
his efforts but was not to be deluded. There
were other speakers, too, and they wasted a lot of
words, in the judgment of their hearers. What was
the good of being hopeful when there wasn’t any hope
left?</p>

<p>But on Thursday evening the meeting was different.
Though defeat was still accepted as inevitable, the notion
of taking it lying down was no longer popular. The
sentiment to-night favored getting in just as many
good, hard licks as was possible before being counted
out. There was still a strong “We who are about to
die salute you” savor to proceedings, but the salutation
was distinctly defiant. A courteous letter from the
Wolcott Academy Athletic Association deploring the
unfortunate loss to Wyndham of its Head Coach was
read and almost moved the hearers to tears. Somehow,
there seemed something quite touching in the idea of
the lion sympathizing with its victim before devouring
him! Wyndham cheered that letter to the echo.</p>

<p>The Scrub did not disband on Wednesday, according
to custom, although Wednesday witnessed the final real
game between it and First. At Mr. Babcock’s direction
the Scrub postponed dissolution for twenty-four hours
and on Thursday lined up opposite the big team for
some twenty minutes while the latter put the polishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
touches on several plays, among them Number 30.
Tackling was prohibited, and the somewhat ludicrous
spectacle of Billy Desmond and Al Greene scowling
darkly at each other without once coming to grips was
presented. The captaincy of the Scrub had fallen to
Johnny Thayer on Monday, and it was Johnny who
gathered the team about him in the early twilight that
Thursday afternoon and led the cheer.</p>

<p>“Win, win, Wyndham! Win, win, Wyndham!
Win, win, Wyndham! Scrub! <em>Scrub!</em> SCRU-U-UB!”</p>

<p>The First cheered then, and after that the Scrub
cheered the First, and the audience cheered the Scrub
and the Scrub cheered Mr. Connover, and Mr. Connover
cheered—no, that isn’t right! But there was a
good deal of cheering and noise; and a good deal of
laughter as the Scrub formed in line and, eighteen
strong, marched off abreast behind a long strip of
white oilcloth bearing the inscription in large black
letters: THE FIGHTING SCRUB—The Team That
Put the “Win” in Wyndham—Scrub 13; F. H. S. 0—Scrub 26;
T. A. 9—Scrub 13; W. 2nd 12—WE
WERE GOOD AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT!</p>

<p>Clif held his breath and turned the cold full on,
shivered deliciously as the icy water peppered his glowing
body and broke into song:</p>

<p>Then he turned the shower off, reached for his towel
and dried himself, avoiding the still trickling sprinkler
above. Well, that was over! No more football until
next fall. It was a sort of relief, too. There had
been just about enough of it. Of course he would feel
horribly lost for a week or so, but there were compensations.
For instance, eats! For six weeks and more
he hadn’t had a piece of pie, and the pie at Wyndham
was <em>good</em>! To-morrow he wouldn’t have to pass his
piece across to Crosby. No, sir. And he wouldn’t
have to think whether he ought to eat this, that and
the other. No, sir, he’d just <em>eat</em> it!</p>

<p>There wasn’t much drying necessary, and after a
moment Clif wrapped the damp towel about him and
padded his way along the wet tile floor to the locker-room.
And there was Johnny Thayer, disgracefully
unadorned, striding toward him and grinning like a
catfish, and holding him with a glittering eye. Clif
knew that something portentous was about to happen.
He had one of Tom’s “hunches.” Johnny stayed him
with two hands against his bare chest and spoke in
hoarse elation.</p>

<p>“You and ‘Wink’ and I go to the First! What do
you know?”</p>

<p>“Ice-cold water on the head is good,” replied Clif.
But his levity was strained, for he knew that Johnny
was talking true talk.</p>

<p>“It’s gospel! ‘Cocky’ just told me. Ask ‘Wink.’
He’s over there.”</p>

<p>“Did he say me, too?” asked Clif, conscious of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
fact that his heart was thumping as if he had just
completed an eighty-yard run. Johnny nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>“The three of us, old ruffian! Ain’t it great? Gee,
they have to come to the Fighting Scrub when they
want real talent!”</p>

<p>“But, I don’t see— What’s the big idea? Where
do I fit in? You and ‘Wink,’ sure, but me—”</p>

<p>“Oh, ‘Cocky’’ll find a use for you, Clif. Trust that
old bird! Say, I’m tickled to death! Gee, why, we’ll
get our letters, anyway; all three of us probably!
What price me with a big blue W on my tummy?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know, Johnny. We mightn’t. There’s
a lot of fellows on that First Team squad now. I
don’t see what he’s going to do with us all!”</p>

<p>“Feed us to Wolcott one at a time. Maybe ‘Cocky’s’
idea is to give Wolcott indigestion, eh? Anyway, I
should concern myself. All I want is a chance at some
of those big stiffs. That and my letter!”</p>

<p>Johnny strode gloriously on toward the showers and
Clif mingled with the crowd that filled the locker-room.
Oddly, no one took any notice of him; just as if he
hadn’t been joined up with the First at all! But, he
consoled himself, they probably hadn’t heard yet. He
sought out Tom with his eyes and waved a brown
stocking at him. Tom waved back, but it was evident
that he didn’t know. His wave had been too casual.
Clif chuckled and hurried his dressing. He would wait
for Tom and tell him the thrilling news on the way
to Hall!</p>

<small>WYNDHAM PLAYS WOLCOTT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Friday was an unreal sort of a day to Clif. He
made a miserable fizzle of three recitations and
conducted himself generally as though he was
sleep-walking. It was only at three-thirty that he really
became conscious. Then he came out of his trance and
trotted around the field at the end of a line of seven
third-string players, trying to get the signals right
when Braley barked them. Two other squads indulged
in the same recreation; and there were several fellows
left out, at that, for the Wyndham First Team now
consisted of thirty-seven players. Clif’s squad was the
last to quit signal drill, and after it was over he joined
a dozen others and caught and threw the ball while the
field gradually emptied. By five the last practice was
over and the last player clumped across the running
track and over the turf to the gymnasium leaving the
field to darkness. Lights were already on in the gymnasium
and East Hall when Clif and “Wink” left the
gridiron.</p>

<p>That evening there was an hour of blackboard drill
in the rowing room from seven-thirty to eight-thirty.
Team members had been given study cuts since recitations
had been abolished for Saturday. After drill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
Mr. Babcock brushed the chalk from his hands and
spoke briefly. “I want every fellow to go from here
right to his room,” said the Coach. “At any rate, keep
away from that cheer meeting over there. Read or
talk for a while and then get to bed. Bedtime to-night
is nine-thirty for all of you. No matter if you aren’t
sleepy. Get into bed and relax and try not to think
about anything. That’s the best way to get to sleep
that I know of.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a hard job ahead of us, fellows, but
we’re equal to it. I tell you honestly that you’re good
enough to beat Wolcott to-morrow, if you’ll do your
best and fight hard. We’ve had our troubles here, as
you know, but we’ve surmounted them all just as fast
as they showed themselves. We’ve had to change our
whole plan of battle at the last minute, but we’ve developed
another plan that will answer fully as well. I
don’t want one of you to acknowledge to himself the
possibility of defeat. I tell you you’re going to win.
But you’ve got to believe it yourselves, and you’ve got
to <em>work</em>. Keep your thoughts right, fellows. Say to
yourselves, ‘I’m going to play harder to-morrow than
I ever played in my life, just as all the others are going
to, and together we’re going to win!’ Half the battle
is in having faith. The other half is in doing. Cultivate
the will to win. Now we’ll go out quietly, with
no cheering. We’ll leave the cheering until to-morrow
evening.”</p>

<p>Over in assembly hall, Doctor Wyndham finished his
speech by reading a letter from Coach Otis. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
only a few lines in length, predicting a Wyndham victory
and counseling the School to stand firm behind the
Team and show its faith. There were cheers for the
Principal and for the absent coach and a big, long cheer
for Wyndham, and then the meeting stampeded through
the doors and down the hall and formed again outside
and became quite mad. Clif and Tom, up in Number
17, stopped their talk and listened.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<em>Rah, rah, rah! Drayton!</em>”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“<em>Rah, rah, rah! Cotter!</em>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On they went, through the long list. “<em>Rah, rah, rah!
Kemble!</em>” Clif grinned nervously. He was afraid
they would cheer him and afraid they wouldn’t. They
did, at last. And they ended up with “Wink” Coles.
After that there was a moment of confused shouting
and then came a long cheer for the Team. Subsequently
a strident voice began “Whoop It Up” and
every one down there joined in and the bravely rollicking
strains drowned Tom’s statement that it was close
to half-past and he guessed he’d better hit the hay.
He waited until the song was over, humming the words
softly, and then nodded and closed the door behind
him. Alone, Clif sat for several minutes where Tom
had left him while the sounds below quieted and died
away. Finally he began to undress and discovered to
his surprise that his fingers were trembling so that they
made hard work of the buttons!</p>

<p>Clif didn’t go to Cotterville with his father, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
the latter appeared at Freeburg long before eleven
o’clock. Trying hard to seem offhand and casual, Clif
explained the circumstances, but he had to grin when
Mr. Bingham jammed his thumb against the horn button
and sent forth a strident wail that populated the
steps of East and West Halls in something under three
seconds.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” exclaimed Mr. Bingham. “Gosh,
son, that’s great news, isn’t it? Aren’t you mighty
proud, eh? Hang it all, don’t stand there and make
believe you’re not! I am, anyway. Yes, sir!”</p>

<p><em>Toot, to-o-o-ot!</em> went the horn.</p>

<p>“Gee, dad, don’t!” begged Clif. “The fellows’ll
think—”</p>

<p>“What if they do?” laughed his father. “I want
them to!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bingham took Walter Treat and three other
boys of Walt’s choosing over to Cotterville, while Clif
traveled in one of the three big busses that rolled away
at twelve to the cheering of their companions, massed
in front of West. Loring, declining Mr. Babcock’s offer
of transportation, was one of many youths who made
the trip by auto in company with parents or friends.
Loring rode between his father and mother, and Wattles
sat with the chauffeur, who, to Wattles’s disgust,
knew no football save soccer. Wattles had a thoroughly
pleasant ride, and by the time Cotterville was reached
the chauffeur had become vastly better informed on
one subject at least.</p>

<p>Clif and Tom had tried to stick together, but somehow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
in the confusion of departure they had got into
different busses. Clif had Joe Whitemill and Phil
Cotter for immediate neighbors. Phil was in rather
hectic spirits and, claiming to have founded Cotterville,
related many humorous and hitherto unpublished incidents
connected with the early history of the town.
He flatly refused, however, to accept responsibility
for Wolcott Academy. That misfortune, he stoutly
averred, had taken place during one of his absences
from the old home.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly, but there was a cold northwest
wind blowing and much speculation was indulged
in as to the effect of that wind on the kicking game.
There was a good deal of discussion about Wyndham’s
chances, and what sort of a line Wolcott had and
whether its ends were any better than last year’s. And
now and then they sang a little. But the singing soon
petered out. Every fellow in the bus at one time or
another fell into silent abstraction. Clif didn’t say a
great deal. His remarks were spasmodic and his
laughter somewhat tuneless. Away down inside somewhere
he was scared, and, while he assured himself
countless times that there wasn’t the ghost of a chance
of his getting into the game, unless for a moment at
the end that he might get his letter, at the back of his
mind the thought persisted that he might be called on.
He tried to remember the play numbers and discovered
to his horror that he had forgotten nearly all! He
finally got hold of the straight buck sequence, 2 to 5,
but couldn’t remember what 6 was. Nor 7. Nor 8—hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
on, though, 8 was a cross-buck with left half
carrying. Gradually memory returned, although to the
end of the journey six plays eluded him. He might
have asked Whitemill or Cotter, but he was ashamed
to. Besides, there would be time enough on the bench
in which to refresh his memory.</p>

<p>When the busses passed through a village there was
loud cheering, not only for Wyndham but for anything
else that captured interest. At Peyton a much bewhiskered
citizen leaning against a post in front of the
general store made an instant hit. Three royal cheers
were given for “Ostermoor”—though how the fellows
knew his name must remain a mystery—and the surprised
gentleman was the recipient of many compliments.
Between the villages opportunities for “razzing”
were fewer but never neglected. A faster car,
passing a bus, was pursued by indignant cries of
“Speedhound!” “Oooh, wait till I tell the Constabule!”
“Hey, Mister! You’re hittin’ twenty!” “Oh, you
Dare-devil!” “You pesky city folks, you!” All this,
Clif found, helped you to forget that your luncheon,
as light as it had been, had become a leaden lump and
that there was a spot somewhere between the nape of
your neck and the top of your head that felt like a
small lump of ice!</p>

<p>At Cotterville they pulled up in front of a small
yellow frame building at the edge of the athletic field.
Across a wide stretch of still green turf the school
buildings peered back at them from behind nearly
leafless trees. It was twenty minutes past one then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
and the game was to start at two-fifteen, but already
there was a trickling stream of folks crossing the far
side of the field in the direction of the iron stands.
Many automobiles, too, were in place beyond the ropes,
and the occupants were having picnic lunches there.
Above the grandstand a big brown flag bearing a white
W waved and whipped in the wind. The sun was
doing its best for the occasion. It made the freshly
drawn lines of the gridiron gleam, gave the dying grass
a real semblance of summer verdancy, found a clump
of birches on the nearby hillside that still held their
leaves and made a golden splendor of them and, flashing
against the varnished surfaces of the parked cars,
created blobs of light that dazzled the eyes. And over
there, too, it discovered a fluttering blue pennant bearing
a white W and illumined it gloriously.</p>

<p>In the field house Dan Farrell, the trainer, laid out
the contents of his bags and the haunting odor of his
own special liniment permeated the quarters. The call
to change into togs came at half-past one and at a
quarter to two they were all ready. Mr. Babcock and
Mr. Hilliard and Mr. Connover ended their low-voiced
conference in a corner and herded the players outside
to the sunlit porch. It wasn’t one of the coaches,
though, who spoke to them then. It was Captain Dave
Lothrop, and partly because Dave never did say much
and even now couldn’t find the right words, although
he tried hard enough, his little speech got under their
skins. He didn’t say anything new. Indeed, what is
there new that may be said at such times? It has all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
been said over and over again, hundreds, thousands
of times, since the first football team was formed.
But Dave, floundering, seeking desperately for words,
his eyes fixed on the barred field over yonder,
managed to endow old sounds with a fresh meaning.</p>

<p>“Coach says we can do it, fellows,” said Dave.
“He’s not lying to us. Besides, I know, too. I know
that if we think—if we just <em>say</em> we can lick ’em—go
out there and fight every minute, every second, just
forgetting everything but beating Wolcott—why, I
<em>know</em> we can, fellows! We’ve got to fight, fight <em>hard</em>.
Well, we can do it. We’ve got to fight harder than
they fight. We can do that, too. I—I wouldn’t want
to lead you fellows out there if I wasn’t certain right
down to my boots that you meant to lick those guys.
Think what it would be like to go back to Wyndham
to-night beaten. We couldn’t face the School! Why,
hang it, we’ve <em>got</em> to win! That’s all there is to it.
We’ve <em>got</em> to win! And when you’ve got to do a thing,
you—you”—Dave’s gaze came back from the gridiron
and challenged them—“you do it, if you’re not yellow!
Well, that’s all. Only”—Dave shot out a big fist—“tell
me this. Are you going to fight? Are you going
to <em>win</em>?”</p>

<p>“<em>Yes!</em>” The reply was an explosion of pent-up
emotions, a determined, defiant, exalted burst of sound
that carried far across the sunlit field.</p>

<p>“<em>Come on, then!</em>” said Dave.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the gridiron was empty again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
A silver half-dollar had spun into the sunlight and
dropped to the turf. Captains and officials were back
on the side-lines. The raucous blaring of the Wolcott
Student Band was stilled, the cheering had momentarily
hushed and the throng that filled every seat in the
stand and overflowed along the ropes drew coats and
wraps higher, resettled in their places and braced themselves
for the fray. Then eleven brown-stockinged
youths ran out from one side of the barred battlefield
and eleven blue-stockinged youths from the other, and
the cheers began again and the Wolcott bass-drummer
thumped mightily and several thousand persons, many
of them normally unemotional, experienced a sudden
shortness of breath accompanied by a fluttery sensation
of the heart. And at about that moment, on the east
side of the field, a man in a black derby confided to a
man in a chauffeur’s livery that, “That’s the captain
of our side, Henry. Lothrop his name is. He’s to
kick the ball away.”</p>

<p>“With them long legs, and the powerful looks of
him,” responded his companion with relish, “I’m
thinkin’ them other laddies’ll be chasin’ it back to the
hills yonder!”</p>

<p>That no such performance as that was contemplated
or desirable was being explained when <a href="#i_frontispiece">the ball sailed
up and away</a> and the informant relapsed into silence.
Somewhere at the north end of the field a player caught
the pigskin, tucked it against him and went down before
he had taken two strides. The Wyndham cheers
burst forth, high and sharp. Wolcott tried the Wyndham<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
left and was repulsed, shot her fullback at Desmond
and got three yards and then punted far, the wind
that quartered the gridiron adding a good ten yards to
the kick. Wyndham ran the ball back six yards or
so, tried two slams at the brown line and punted back
to Wolcott’s forty. The ancient enemies were trying
each other out.</p>

<p>Wolcott got three yards outside Cotter and two more
through Captain Dave, but a five-yard penalty set her
back and again she punted on third down. This time
the ball rolled over the line. Jensen got free around
Wolcott’s left end and carried the pigskin on the first
down to the twenty-eight yards. Ogden, from kicking
position, tried a straight buck on right tackle and was
thrown for a yard loss. Jensen made two outside left
tackle and Ogden punted short to midfield, where the
ball went out. Not until the quarter was almost over
did either team bid for a score. Then Wolcott tried
a short forward-pass over the center that grounded
and followed it from the same formation with a fake
that sent left half around the right for fourteen yards
and placed the ball on Wyndham’s twenty-eight. A
cross-buck on Cotter failed of an inch and Wolcott
again threw forward. This time the throw was long,
fast and low and aimed at the corner of the field. Over
there, close to the goal-line, the Brown’s left halfback
turned as the pigskin sped forward. Four strides would
have taken him across, but, although he had skillfully
eluded the Wyndham defense until now, Nemesis, in
the form of Pete Jensen, was at hand, and while Pete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
couldn’t get in position to steal the catch he could and
did bat the ball aside.</p>

<p>With two downs left, Wolcott sent her fullback outside
right tackle from kicking position and gained four
yards, placing the ball on the twenty-four. From the
thirty-three, with quarterback holding the ball, Johnson,
Wolcott’s rangy left tackle, tried a goal from
placement while the Wyndham cohorts held their
breaths. Johnson had the quartering gale to figure
with, and it seemed that he underestimated the force
of it, for the pigskin, while it started true enough, met
the full strength of the wind before it had covered
half the distance and swerved widely to the left. Not
until an official waved his arms negatively, though, was
Wyndham certain that the effort had failed.</p>

<p>A minute later, after Wyndham had punted, the
whistle blew and the teams made for the water pails.
The Wolcott band came to life again, and the cheer
leaders swung their megaphones. Then Wyndham
took the north goal and faced the enemy on the thirty-nine
yards. There were no changes in the Wyndham
line-up. Archer and Drayton were still the ends, Cotter
and Weldon the tackles, Lothrop and Desmond the
guards, Carlson the center, Stoddard the quarter,
Whitemill and Jensen the halfs and Ogden the fullback.
Nor had Wolcott yet altered her team. The
opposing elevens were strikingly alike in appearance.
Each presented a center trio of big, fairly heavy men
closely matched for height and weight. Each featured
fast, rangy tackles and rather light ends. In the backfield<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
Wolcott had a slight advantage in weight, for
James, her fullback, was a fellow after “Big Bill”
Fargo’s style, although he lacked Fargo’s ability to
start quickly and was far less dangerous on end runs.
Wolcott’s quarter had weight and carried the ball frequently.
Her halfbacks were fairly light and showed
speed. One, Hoskins, had already proved himself a
very shifty player.</p>

<p>The second period saw a good deal of old-fashioned
football on the part of Wolcott and a punting game
on the part of the opponent. Wolcott used straight
plunges and slants with sufficient success to take her
to the Blue’s thirty-six yards. There her gains lessened
and two sweeping plays and two forward-passes took
her no further than the twenty-seven, where she yielded
the ball. Hoskins was the Brown’s forward-pass ace,
but Hoskins was so closely watched that he was unable
to show anything. Wyndham punted on second down
and watched for a break. With that wind quartering
the field a fumble by a Wolcott back would have surprised
no one. But the break didn’t come. Wolcott
declined to catch the punts after two narrow escapes
and the ball was allowed to roll, twice going over the
goal line for touchbacks. Four penalties were handed
out by the referee, two to each team, but none affected
the fortunes of the game appreciably. The whistle
ended the half fifty-two minutes after the kick-off.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br>
<small>WATTLES AGREES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The teams trailed off and the rival cheering
sections became concertedly vocal once more.
One had to either cheer or sing if only to
keep warm! The Wolcott songsters followed the band
through a martial effort that wasn’t a great success
because most of the fellows had forgotten the words
and sang “dum-ti-dum-dum” instead. Then Dodson,
Wyndham cheer captain, tossed aside his big blue megaphone
and threw his arms aloft.</p>

<p>“Let’s have ‘We Beat Her,’ fellows! Everybody
into it and make it snappy. All right! <em>‘We-e-e—’!</em>”</p>

<p>Whereupon the visiting contingent answered with
their latest effusion, sung to the tune of a popular
ballad of the year:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We beat her back in ’16, in ’17 once more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We swamped her in ’20 with a sixteen-nothing score!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">We beat her in ’21 when she couldn’t hold the ball,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">But this year, on her own field, we’ll beat her worst of all!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Wyndham had no band to aid—or hinder—but she
made the welkin ring. Dodson, white-sweatered,
leaped and danced and kept time with waving arms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
and swaying body. “Great! Once more now! All
sing!” They responded valiantly, louder than before
since many, previously silent, found courage and lifted
their voices. Wolcott applauded and laughed and
came back with a derisive composition in which
“Wyndham” was insultingly punned with “wind ’em.”</p>

<p>Across the field, Mr. Deane lighted a fresh cigar
and said: “Well, it looks as if they’d pulled that fellow’s
teeth, eh? What’shisname, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Hoskins?” asked Loring. “Yes, I don’t believe he
will trouble us much, father. Mr. Babcock set two
men to covering him and he hasn’t got away with anything
yet. What Wolcott may do, though, is fake a
throw to Hoskins and send the ball the other way.
That might catch us napping.”</p>

<p>“How did you spy that fellow, Lory?”</p>

<p>“They ran him on near the end of last week’s game.
Wolcott had scored a touchdown and a field-goal in
the first half and sent her first-string men off to the
showers. After that she couldn’t do much. The other
team got scrappy and held Wolcott twice inside its
twenty yards. I think Wolcott thought she ought to
have one score at least to show for the last half and
took a chance. Anyway, after she’d used up two downs
over there near the twenty-five-yard line she called
Hoskins in, and he sifted through on the first play and
trotted down to the corner of the field, just as he did
a few minutes ago. The ball went right into his hands
and he stepped over the line for a touchdown. Then
he was taken right out again. I saw the trainer hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
him his sweater and send him back to the gym. That
was all I needed to see, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Deane chuckled, and Mrs. Deane said admiringly:
“I think that was very, very clever, dear.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, moms, but it really wasn’t. Any one could
have called the turn. I suppose they thought we didn’t
know that they’d been working up that forward-passing
stuff under cover. They’d kept it pretty well hidden.
If they had thought twice, though, they wouldn’t have
shown their hand like that.”</p>

<p>“It’s safe to say they wish they hadn’t,” chuckled
Mr. Deane. “I suppose they’re wondering now what
happened, eh?”</p>

<p>“They know what happened,” laughed Loring, “but
it’s a bit late! I wish we had managed to get one score
in that half, though. Wolcott will come back pretty
hard, I guess.”</p>

<p>Both teams had made changes when they faced each
other once more. For Wyndham, Williams was at left
end, Couch at right end, Higgs at center, Breeze at
right guard and Houston at quarter. The Blue chose
the north goal and kicked off to Wolcott. The wind
had decreased perceptibly and grown flukey, and
Ogden’s kick-off went out of bounds on Wolcott’s
twenty-seven yards. Three minutes later the Brown
had crossed the middle of the field and taken the pigskin
into Wyndham territory. Faking a forward-pass,
she sent her left half, a fresh player who had
relieved Hoskins, on a wide run around the right end.
Couch was neatly boxed and the ball went to the thirty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
yards. Wolcott was going now. Concentrating
on the Wyndham left, she made first down on the
twenty-two, sending Cotter out of the game. Longwell
took his place. Wolcott tried Longwell and made
a scant two. A short heave over tackle on the right
bounded out of the catcher’s hands, was fumbled by
Ogden and grounded. With eight to go on third down,
Wolcott elected to try a field goal. She attempted one
more smash first, though, and pulled in another two
yards through Captain Lothrop. Then the ball shot
back to her right tackle, who had retreated to the
twenty-nine yards, and, although the Wyndham forwards
tore through desperately, arose again safely and
sailed squarely across the bar for the first score.</p>

<p>The Brown’s adherents went wild with joy, the big
drum boomed, and automobile horns blared stridently.
Wyndham’s cheer, though, was loud and undismayed
as the teams went back to midfield. Wolcott kicked
off. Houston caught, juggled for a heart-breaking
instant, dodged the first Wolcott end and then plunged
straight ahead. A second tackler tried, missed and
went down. A hasty interference formed about the
runner, Weldon in the lead, mowing down the enemy.
At the thirty-six yards, forced away from his interference,
Houston was pulled to earth after a stirring
run of thirty yards.</p>

<p>Wyndham kept the ball to Wolcott’s thirty-nine,
Ogden and Jensen alternating at slants that tore off
four, five, once eight yards. On the enemy’s thirty-nine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
an off-side penalty set the Blue back and, after
two plunges that netted little, Ogden punted to the
Brown’s five. The Wolcott quarter refused the catch
and the ball bounced erratically back in the direction
it had traveled. Weldon put it down on the fourteen
yards. Wolcott tried one off-tackle play from kick
formation and gained three. Then she punted, James,
her fullback, standing close to the five yards. Lothrop
broke through and hurried the kick and the pigskin
went high and was shortened by the wind. Jensen
caught close to the side-line on Wolcott’s thirty-two,
made three and was thrown out.</p>

<p>The Blue took up her journey again, a short pass,
Ogden to Houston, yielding seven yards and Ogden
carrying the ball through the right side for a first down.
Wyndham cheerers were chanting “Touchdown, Wyndham!
Touchdown, Wyndham! Touchdown, Wyndham!”
Wolcott asked for time and put in a fresh left
guard. Ogden ran up against a stone wall on the next
play and Jensen was nabbed trying to slide off left
tackle, and Captain Lothrop stepped back to the thirty
and held out his hands. When the ball came he plunged
straight ahead and got four through the center. Tom
Kemble reported and Whitemill went off. Tom went
back to kick. Higgs passed badly and the ball reached
him on the ground. There was no time to straighten
up and get the kick off, for Wolcott was piling through
on him. So Tom thumped the ball to his stomach and
started off to the right. He dodged one enemy,
squirmed free of another, turned sharply in, twisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
and turned and finally went down. He had added three
yards, but three was not enough.</p>

<p>Wolcott decided to punt out of danger on first down
and James went back to the four yards. This time it
was the Wolcott center who offended, and the ball
reached the fullback above his head. He caught it,
but both Lothrop and Weldon had broken through
and were bearing down on him on each side. The
ball went no farther than Weldon’s upflung arm and
then bounded back. James was down, but a Wolcott
halfback won the race to the ball, picked it up on the
bound and sought to circle the goal. Dave Lothrop
brought him down just short of the line and Wyndham
had a safety, two points to flaunt against Wolcott’s
three!</p>

<p>Wolcott kicked from the thirty-yard line, and the
quarter ended after Kemble had caught on his own
thirty-two and carried the ball to the thirty-seven.</p>

<p>For the last period Wyndham had the wind against
her, but it was now little more than a strong breeze,
and occasionally the big brown flag above the grandstand
fell limply about the staff. More changes were
made by Mr. Babcock. Archer went back at left and
Carlson at center. Raiford took Weldon’s place,
Sproule went in at right half and “Swede” Hanbury
relieved Ogden. Wyndham made four changes in her
line, sending back three veterans of the first half, and
introduced a fresh quarter.</p>

<p>Wyndham reached midfield on six plays, only to
lose the ball when Sproule fumbled. Wolcott was then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
first down on her own forty-eight yards. On the first
play a penalty for holding set her back to her thirty-three.
A long pass over the right end went astray
and a second attempt on the other side was no more
successful. James punted short and the ball went out
at Wyndham’s forty-seven. Breeze was taken off and
Clem Henning succeeded him at right guard. Sproule
got free outside tackle and took the ball to the opponent’s
forty-one. Hanbury made three and then four
over right tackle. Kemble was thrown for a loss on
an attempt at the Wolcott left end and Hanbury punted.
The ball went over and was brought back to the twenty.</p>

<p>Wolcott was playing for time now, satisfied, it
seemed, with her one-point lead. She made it first
down on her thirty-two with a short and unexpected
forward toss and then, faking a second throw, tore
through Henning for six. Hanbury, who made the
tackle, was hurt and time was called. Presently he
went off, assisted, and Johnny Thayer raced on. Wolcott
struck a snag on the next play and lost two yards.
A forward-pass over left guard grounded, after being
juggled by half the players, and James kicked. Again
the punt fell short and the ball was Wyndham’s on her
forty-four yards. Raiford gave way to “Wink” Coles
and Couch to Clif Bingham.</p>

<p>The Blue crossed the half-way mark on two plays
with Johnny Thayer carrying, each play a fake cross-buck
in which the halfbacks went outside tackle and
the fullback drove straight through guard. Wyndham
had used few split interference plays so far and Wolcott<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
was easy prey; Johnny got four yards through
right guard and seven through left. Kemble crashed
at left tackle for three more and then went outside the
same player for four. Thayer added two through
center, and, with less than one to go on fourth down,
Houston cut through left guard for the distance.
Sproule again got loose around his left and reached
the enemy’s twenty-six before he was forced over the
line. Thayer made two and Kemble two and Houston
went back to kicking position. The play was a short
pass, however, and Clif, on the catching end, failed to
get his fingers on it. Time was called for Captain
Dave and, after Dan Farrell had worked over him,
Wyndham took a two-yard penalty, Captain Dave staying
in. Houston took a good pass from Carlson and
got the ball away cleanly, but it fell short of the bar.</p>

<p>Time was growing short and the figures on the
scoreboard looked to be final. James punted on first
down and put the oval down near the opponent’s forty-five,
his longest punt of the day. Tom Kemble misjudged
and Houston got the ball on the bound and
was thrown savagely on his thirty-six. Time was again
called, and when play was resumed, Stoddard was back
at quarter. Wolcott had seized the opportunity to
bolster up her line with a new tackle and end on the
left. Stoddard used a fake cross-buck again and
Thayer found a wide hole at the left of center and
romped through for twelve yards. On a similar play
he was downed on the line. There were two minutes
left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>Kemble tried the end and made a yard and Sproule
had no better luck off tackle. Kemble went back and
hurled across the center to Stoddard for eight yards
and a first down. With Kemble back again, the ball
went to Thayer, and Johnny got six on a sweep around
right end before he was smothered. Sproule and then
Kemble hit right guard and made it first down
again. The ball was on Wolcott’s thirty-one yards
and there was just under a minute of playing
time left.</p>

<p>Captain Lothrop went out, cheered to the echo, and
Smythe took his place. Ellison went in for Carlson
and Treader for Sproule. Wyndham was still cheering
valiantly, hopefully. Treader, squandering all the
pent-up energy and longing of the afternoon in one
brief instant, dashed himself fiercely at the enemy’s
right and squirmed and fought through to the twenty-six.
Wyndham roared in triumph and automobile
horns sounded raucously.</p>

<p>“<em>Touchdown! Touchdown!</em>” chanted Wyndham,
while Wolcott implored her warriors to “<em>Hold ’em!
Hold ’em! Hold ’em!</em>” Then Tom again went back
and the visiting cheerers changed their slogan. “<em>Kick
that goal! Kick that goal!</em>” was the cry now. Out
on the field the effect was only of so much sound, confused,
meaningless, and Houston had to shout high
to be heard.</p>

<p>“<em>30, 87, 27!</em>”</p>

<p>Archer swung away from the line and ran back
toward his own goal. Tom held his long arms out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
The timer’s watch told twenty seconds left. The signal
came again:</p>

<p>“<em>30, 87</em>—”</p>

<p>The ball left Ellison and sped back to Tom. Archer
swung to the left and crossed behind. Tom, too, was
running that way now, the ball before him, and so
were Treader and Houston, and so carefully were they
spaced that not one of the enemy save the left end saw
the ball pass from Tom to Archer behind that moving
screen. But that left end, coming through inside Clif
Bingham, was not able to use his knowledge to advantage,
for Treader crashed into him and he went down,
sprawling in the path of the runners. The Wolcott
right end, speeding around, met Thayer, and that fact
kept him, too, forever out of the play. Treader and
Houston swept on around the right, but Tom, slackening
speed, tarried while Archer, still running toward
the side-line, found his position for the throw. Then
a Wolcott tackle came plunging up, and Tom had his
work cut out for him. As he and the brown-stockinged
foe met, Archer dropped his right arm behind his shoulder,
swept it forward again and threw, straight and
hard, down the field from the thirty-six yards.</p>

<p>No one had seriously interfered with Clif when the
ball had been snapped. Dodging wide, he had let the
Wolcott left end past inside him. Then, warily, as
though only desirous of avoiding the rough encounters
behind, he sped none too hurriedly across three white
marks. The Wolcott left halfback started toward him,
but after one stride changed his course. To him the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
play was what it seemed, a fake kick and a wide sweep
about the left of his line, and he hurried up to get into
it. Midway between the five-yard-line and the ten Clif
stopped and swung about. If the play had been timed
right the ball should be already on its way. It was.
So, too, was the Wolcott quarterback, and, further
away, others. But the ball came faster than they, and
it came true.</p>

<p>Clif set himself, held his hands out for it, felt it
thump into them, tightened his clutch about it, turned
and ran. There was but one white mark to cross before
the goal-line, and he had spurned it before the enemy
reached him. Then came the supreme test. The Wolcott
quarterback launched himself forward, but Clif
had anticipated the tackle by the fraction of a second.
He twisted to the right, perilously close to the side-line,
spun, saw the enemy go sprawling past, hands clutching,
emptily, leaped the falling body and was safe.
There was the last white streak a stride away and he
had crossed it before the second enemy reached him,
crossed it and dropped to earth, the battered ball held
tightly wrapped in his arms!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Wyndham Team held its banquet on Wednesday
night at the Inn. There were many speeches made
and many songs sung, and a whole batch of congratulatory
messages were read by Captain Dave. There
was one from Coach Otis and another from “Big Bill”
Fargo amongst them. Nearly forty persons occupied
the three big tables that had been placed end to end,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
but all were not team members. Besides the coaches,
and Dan Farrell, the trainer, and Mr. Frost, representing
the Faculty, there was a boy in a wheel chair.
Several speakers of the evening had done their best to
embarrass this guest; notably Mr. Babcock who had
gone into sickening details in his account of how
Wyndham had spiked Wolcott’s guns. But Loring
bore up very well, for, after all, he was only human,
and he <em>had</em> done his bit toward that 8 to 3 victory.
They sang that charming ditty “We Beat Her” several
times, though now the last line had been altered to
“And what we did last Saturday we’ll do again next
fall!” And finally they sang “Shadowed Walls,” all
standing, and cheered for Wyndham—the long cheer
with nine booming “Wyndhams” on the end—and
broke up.</p>

<p>Wattles, waiting outside the door, took charge of
Loring, and the wheel chair trundled along Oak Street
with Clif on one side and Tom on the other. Ahead
of them and behind echoes of the evening sounded.
Carlson and Jensen, arms entwined, confided to a star-sprinkled
sky that “We beat her back in ’16.” Farther
behind a cheer arose. Tom, who had emptied the contents
of a dish into a pocket before leaving, shared
salted nuts with the others. Wattles’s refusal to partake
availed him nothing. Tom stopped traffic while
he filled Wattles’s mouth, and for some distance Wattles
couldn’t have spoken had he wanted to.</p>

<p>“Wonder who they’ll elect Saturday,” mused Clif
a moment later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>“Houston or Ogden,” said Tom. “Say, look here,
you fellows! Here’s something I’ve had on my mind
for days. How—”</p>

<p>“Where did you say you’d had it, Tom?” asked
Loring. “I’m afraid I didn’t hear you right.”</p>

<p>“Shut up. Say, how many of the old Scrub fellows
do you think were on the team when we made that
touchdown?”</p>

<p>“Four,” said Loring. “You, Clif, Thayer—”</p>

<p>“Wrong, old son! Five! Count ’em! Five! Clem
Henning—”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” objected Clif, “he was off the Scrub
long before—”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t matter! And who won their old game, anyway?
Why, the old Scrub won it! Henning was right
guard, ‘Wink’ was right tackle, Johnny took the pass
from center, Clif made the touchdown and I—er—supervised
it! Now, then, I ask you, who won the old
ball game?”</p>

<p>Three voices answered loudly, proudly and in chorus
“<em>The Fighting Scrub!</em>” And—</p>

<p>“Hooray!” said Wattles, still articulating with difficulty.
“Quite so, sir!”</p>
